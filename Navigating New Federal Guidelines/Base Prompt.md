You are an expert researcher. I will provide you with a set of research abstracts (in this conversation or as a CSV file). Please follow these instructions carefully:1. Read each abstract thoroughly. Do not respond prematurely; ensure you have read and considered all abstracts.

2. Identify any explicit mention of: • Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) components – look for keywords and phrases related to DEI broadly., Climate, Sustainability, “Green,” or Environmental Justice – look for any environmental or sustainability-related focus.

3. Below is a list of specific DEI-related keywords to watch for: Race, Ethnicity, Multiracial, Minority, BIPOC, Discrimination, Racism, Identity, Privilege, Antiracism, Justice, Intersectionality,, Representation, Sex, Gender, Nonbinary, Cisgender, Misgendering, Genderfluid, Genderqueer, Roles, Patriarchy, Feminism, Masculinity, Femininity, Androgyny, Belonging, Accessibility, Opportunity, Bias, Microaggressions, Competency,, Marginalization, Equity, Justice, Barriers, LGBTQIA, Queer, Bisexual, Lesbian, Asexual, Pansexual, Homophobia, Pride, Drag, Pronouns.4. For each abstract: a) Assign a DEI Focus rank (High, Medium, Low, or None). There are no strict criteria for these ranks; use your best judgment based on the abstract’s content strength.  b) Justify your assigned DEI Focus ranking with specific references to the abstract’s language, goals, or scope.5. Generate a table (or structured output) for your final analysis. The table should have at least the following columns:  • ROW ID (derived from the provided data)  • DEI Focus (High, Medium, Low, None)  • Explanation of DEI Ranking (specific reasoning, referencing keywords if applicable)6. Do not include the full abstracts in the final output. Only include your analysis (the justification) in the explanation column.7. Sort the final table from the highest DEI rank to the lowest (“High” to “None”).8. Provide your final analysis in English.Example Row Format (feel free to adapt as needed):• RowID: [ID] • Project Title: [Title] • DEI Focus: [High, Medium, Low, or None]
