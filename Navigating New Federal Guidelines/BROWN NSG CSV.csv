2,CAREER: From Enriched Private Set Intersection to Broad Applications of Secure Multi-Party Computation,"Advanced data analytics involves performing computation on data sets to produce useful insights. Data analytics finds application across many fields and has enabled major breakthroughs, however the potential has been constrained by challenges in sharing sensitive, distributed data. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) provides a promising solution, allowing multiple parties who have relevant datasets to perform computations on their combined data while preserving privacy. As a special case of MPC, private set intersection (PSI), which securely computes the data elements in common in the private sets, has shown early success in practice. This project expands the initial success of PSI to a much broader range of applications of MPC. The project's novelties are identifying the fundamental challenges that currently limit the use cases of PSI, and developing new tools that not only enhance PSI but also address common challenges in many other MPC problems. The project's broader significance and importance are accelerating the industrial adoption of PSI and extending the frontiers of practical MPC, enabling large-scale, privacy-preserving data analytics on sensitive data. The project includes educational and outreach activities such as integrating research into curricula, organizing mentoring workshops, developing tutorial resources to guide researchers and developers in the field, and mentoring students at all levels, especially those from underrepresented groups in computing.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three main thrusts. First, the project bridges the gap between standard PSI and PSI with enriched functionalities by developing unified frameworks for private join and compute that computes arbitrary functions on the intersection and for fuzzy-matching PSI that identifies fuzzy or noisy matches. Second, the investigator studies large-scale PSI for big data, designing efficient protocols for PSI with unbalanced sets and resources and for streaming data, which are better suited for many real-world scenarios. Finally, the project expands its scope beyond PSI, applying the new techniques to other important MPC problems, including privacy-preserving machine learning, genomic sequence matching, and private information retrieval.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
3,MCA: Neural control of elaborate gestural displays,"Many animals, including humans, communicate using elaborate gestures and body movements. Indeed, such behavior can mediate interactions related to courtship, competition, parenting, cooperation, feeding, and even predatory defense. However, despite the importance of this behavior to survival and reproductive success, as well as its ubiquity in animals, very little is understood about its mechanistic basis. This gap is perhaps largest with respect to the brain. The current project will provide the investigator with training in cutting-edge neuroscience technology that will test how particular brain regions contribute to the production of specialized gestural movements that mediate communication between individuals. The work itself will involve woodpeckers, which readily drum their beaks on trees to notify others of their territory in an attempt to maintain access to important breeding resources. Training that the investigator receives will greatly enhance his research program by allowing him to address a set of novel questions about how brain-level control of behavior is used for communication. Such skills will also elevate the investigator’s ability to train future scientists (e.g., undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students) who are interested in exploring more about how the brain controls social behavior. More broadly, this project includes plans to support the development of STEM educational programming for limited English proficiency (LEP) high school students in the Rhode Island school system. <br/><br/>Gesture and body movement are critical components of animal communication in a diverse range of taxa, yet little is known about how the brain controls such behavior. This project aims to uncover the neural basis of gestural communication, both in terms of gestural production and perception. To do this work, the investigator will receive rigorous training in cutting-edge neural electrophysiology techniques so that brain activity can be recorded in freely displaying animals, as well as animals that perceive such displays. The focal species will be downy woodpeckers, as these birds compete for territories by rapidly jackhammering their bills on trees in the environment. This is one of the most extreme gestural displays on the planet, and thus these birds make an excellent model to pioneer studies that explore how the brain controls this incredible behavior. Accordingly, this research will provide one of the first explorations of the forebrain system that controls discrete movements to facilitate drumming displays. This study will also compare the control of these movements to other non-communicative movements, such as basic locomotion or foraging. Finally, this research will work to establish how perceptual systems in the nervous system facilitate the appraisal of drumming. The auditory forebrain will be the focal point of perception experiments, and this work will provide a first look at how gesture-based displays might be assessed aurally by the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
4,EPSCoR Research Fellows: NSF:Resonant X-ray Studies of Magnetic Structures and Excitations in the Two-Dimensional Limit,"In magnetic materials, the particular microscopic pattern of magnetic ordering is determined by interactions between the materials constituent magnetic moments and can have profound effect on the material properties. A special class of magnetic materials, called frustrated magnets, have magnetic interactions that cannot be mutually satisfied. Such competing magnetic interactions generate exotic magnetic structures that often have the special property that they do not exhibit a net magnetic field, but can still influence electric or thermal currents. This unique characteristic makes frustrated magnets ideal to realize future low energy dissipation spintronic devices. However, characterizing the magnetic structures and microscopic energy scales that stabilize those structures in a given material prepared in device relevant geometries remains an outstanding challenge. This project will develop and use advanced synchrotron x-ray scattering techniques at the National Synchrotron Light Source II to elucidate the magnetic structures and fundamental dynamic response characterizing frustrated magnetic materials in nanoscale device relevant configurations. The material parameters quantified through this work will be essential input into theoretical frameworks for predicting physical properties of model frustrated magnets and provide essential input towards incorporating their novel functionalities into future energy efficient technologies. The project will establish a long term sustainable collaboration between Brookhaven National Laboratory and Brown University to train graduate students in synchrotron x-ray techniques and magnetic materials characterization.<br/><br/>Frustrated van der Waals magnets offer unprecedented opportunities to realize new magnetic phases of matter exhibiting complex, multi-sublattice, magnetic textures. Such magnetic textures may exhibit a vanishing net magnetization and hold great promise for fast and low dissipation spintronic devices because they exhibit a vanishing net magnetization. However, elucidating the underlying microscopic physics of new and existing materials is challenging because the antiferromagnetic textures span broad length scales, do not couple directly to magnetic fields, and there is a current lack of measurements that can directly probe magnet structures and excitations in the two-dimensional limit. This project will catalyze a long term sustainable collaboration between researchers at Brookhaven National Lab and Brown University to develop new probes of magnetic order and excitations in two-dimensional materials and across nanometer length scales. Planned work comprises a comprehensive resonant x-ray scattering program to probe the static and dynamic response functions of model frustrated magnets. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering will be used to quantify the dimensional evolution of dynamic magnetic response functions in a model van der Waals antiferromagnet, exfoliated to the two-dimensional limit. Resonant elastic x-rays scattering with nano-focused beams will be used to quantify the chiral antiferromagnetic domain distribution in a metallic frustrated magnet, and follow its evolution under applied biasing fields. New tools for quantifying the magnetic response of frustrated antiferromagnets will be developed and used to elucidate their microscopic organizing principles of frustrated magnets and provide essential input for the design of antiferromagnetic spintronics that require precise domain control.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
5,EPSCoR Research Fellows: NSF: In Situ Structural Characterization of Copper-Carbon Heterostructures for Renewable Energy,"Our society relies on clean sources of energy for food, shelter, transportation, and recreational activities. In recent years, nanomaterials have garnered much interest due to their transformative properties in storing information, catalyzing reactivity, and enhancing electronic dynamics for new modalities and functionalities. This fellowship project explores how an emergent class of nanomaterials based on the fusion of copper with carbon can lead to unprecedented levels of thermal energy management. To accomplish the scientific aims, the team will employ a range of advanced optical and X-ray radiation strategies that shed light on the complex origins of enhanced thermal conductivity on microscopic levels down to tens of nanometers – the length scale of grain boundaries, transport, and chemical structures. The work will further study the flow of electrons and changes through a material under a temperature jump, and how this translates into applied technologies. This new class of materials hold promise for the most demanding and intensive of clean energy applications because of their scalability and projected vast energy savings in electricity, high performance transformer cables, and in powering the national grid with great potentials for transforming societal outcomes in energy resilience and carbon-neutrality. Additionally, a diverse student body will participate as teaching trainees with the outcomes disseminated broadly.<br/><br/>This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) EPSCoR Research Fellows project will provide a fellowship to an Assistant Professor and training for a graduate student at Brown University. This work will be conducted in collaboration with researchers at Argonne National Laboratory. This fellowship aims to explore the physical, electronic, and chemical properties of clean energy-based nanomaterials. The project reveals important information about the charge transfer dynamics and flow of electrons in a highly conductive copper-carbon composite material for the development of novel enhanced thermal conductivity. To this end, the team will investigate the origins of enhanced thermal conduction properties with 2D X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and ultrafast electron diffraction imaging. A range of spectroscopic techniques with high temporal, high spatial, and high energy resolution will help to understand the correspondence between macroscopic thermal conductivity and microscopic electron density changes at the copper-carbon interface. The fellowship will further quantify how size and structure play a role in enhanced electron or thermal transport especially along grain boundaries. Knowledge gained will help to design parameters inherent in chemical and electronic structures that lead to enhanced electron transport mediated by lattice distortions both across the surface of the thin film and its bulk properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
6,OPP-PRF: Finding a Future using the Past: Woodland Caribou Ecology in a Changing Arctic,"Caribou are an ecologically and culturally important species in the Arctic, but their long-term survival is threatened by modern climate change. In the last century, caribou populations have declined considerably throughout their circumpolar range, with many herds shrinking by more than 50% in size. Wildlife managers and scientists must attempt to navigate an uncertain future for this culturally significant mammal, yet focusing solely on modern data provides a limited window into an animal’s ecology. Studying how a species has responded to changes in their environment in the past can greatly inform how they may respond to changes in the future, making the fossil record highly useful for modern conservation challenges. This research will use both modern and paleontological data to investigate how caribou are impacted by changing climactic and environmental conditions. The project will be undertaken in close collaboration with local Canadian and First Nation partners, and results will be used to inform ongoing conservation and management of this threatened species. Further, this project will be leveraged toward a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) at Brown University to broaden participation in polar science. <br/><br/>This project will focus specifically on northern mountain woodland caribou, a threatened ecotype that congregates on alpine ice patches during the summer to escape biting insects, leaving behind dung that becomes permanently frozen in layers of ice for millennia. Researchers will use this unique—but climatically threatened—paleorecord to establish how caribou diet has changed in response to climactic shifts during the Holocene using fecal DNA metabarcoding. This approach will produce taxonomically precise dietary inferences that are rarely achievable from fossil records. Additionally, researchers will use GPS satellite collar data on modern Yukon herds to investigate the dependence of northern mountain woodland caribou on ice patches and how it influences their summer habitat selection. A more detailed understanding of caribou ice patch use is essential for quantifying the impacts of future ice loss as well as interpreting paleoecological data from the ice patch record. This project will address key gaps in our understanding of caribou ecology while further expanding cutting-edge genomic methods for ice-preserved samples.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
7,Pliocene-Pleistocene hydroclimate in northern South America as an analogue for future rainfall regimes in the 21st century,"The Pliocene, from ~5.3 to 2.6 million years ago (Ma), is the last epoch when Earth’s mean temperature was ~3°C warmer than today and CO2 concentrations were sustained at high levels. Global temperatures resembling those of the Pliocene may prevail during the 21st century, making this epoch a valuable opportunity to test our understanding of how the hydrological cycle functions in a warm climate. However, there is insufficient information about rainfall patterns during this time, limiting our ability to assess the mechanisms governing rainfall regimes during times of sustained warmth that could help making predictions about the near-future. This project aims to understand tropical rainfall patterns in northern South America during the Pliocene and across the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary. To achieve this goal, measurements of chemical signals of rainfall preserved in a sediment core from the Bogotá basin at ~4°N will be made. The proposed research will provide an insight into tropical rainfall and water resources that could help regional water managers prepare for the future. This project supports a female, non-native English speaker, Latina postdoctoral researcher as a PI. It will also support the resources for designing and implementing, in both English and Spanish, the following activities: 1) climate literacy lesson plans for elementary school students, teachers, and caregivers and 2) disseminating the results of the project in social media platforms that are culturally relevant to Latin Americans. Developing climate literacy and outreach content in both languages will help cross language barriers and accelerate access to educational materials. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project aims to test the hypotheses about the mechanisms that governed, and may govern in the future, rainfall regimes during the late Pliocene to early-mid Pleistocene in northern South America. This research will generate and interpret a new record of hydrogen isotopic composition of precipitation from plant wax (𝛿Dwax), both with n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids, preserved in the Funza-II core from the Bogotá Basin to detect paleohydrological changes between ~1.5 to 4 Ma. It is also proposed to generate a modern dataset of stable isotope composition of daily rainfall and back-trajectory analysis of rain-bearing air masses to improve the understanding of the regional hydroclimate patterns and variability. δDwax data of the Funza-II will be compared against model outputs and existing hydroclimate and sea surface temperature information to test critical hypotheses about the mechanisms that governed rainfall regimes during the Plio-Pleistocene. It is anticipated that project outcomes will provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms governing the hydrological cycle under these boundary conditions across the Americas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
8,EPSCOR Research Fellows: NSF: Molecular control and probe for emergent quantum phenomena at interfaces,"The flow and location of electrons determine whether materials can conduct electricity or act as insulators, forming the foundation of electronics. In this context, electrons are typically considered free, non-interacting particles. However, in some solid-state materials, electrons strongly interact with each other. These electrons can exhibit highly cooperative behaviors, such as traveling in pairs without resistance, a phenomenon known as superconductivity. Precise control and examination of electron-electron interactions are crucial for advanced information technologies. This project aims to control and visualize the interactions of electrons in atomically-thin materials with sub-nanometer-to-nanometer accuracy. Visualizing the electronic structures of materials with high accuracy, which is currently lacking at Brown University, is critical for studying functional materials. In this regard, the project will take advantage of the advanced surface imaging facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and establish a long-term collaboration between Brown researchers and BNL scientists in quantum science. The project has a potential to transform the PI’s career trajectory and benefit to Brown and to the jurisdiction with the new collaborations. Additionally, the project will involve local high school students in research at Brown and develop outreach modules deliver a basic understanding of quantum phenomena to K-12 students in Rhode Island.<br/><br/>This Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) EPSCoR Research Fellows proposal will provide a fellowship to an Assistant Professor and training for a graduate student at Brown University. Quantum phase transitions, headlined by strongly correlated electrons, have been a major stream in modern physical sciences and play a critical role in quantum information sciences and technologies. Despite their realization in 2D materials, high-precision control and probing of quantum phases down to the molecular level remain a formidable challenge in current research of quantum materials. Tackling this grand challenge requires precise control over the confinement of electronic density of states (DOS), and the ability to detect local static and dynamic information of quantum phases. Leveraging expertise in molecular design and synthesis and 2D device fabrications in the PI’s Lab at Brown University, along with the state-of-the-art scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), the PI will exploit exquisite control in molecular chemistry to realize (1) the control of DOS in 2D systems via 2D-molecule interfacial interactions, and (2) the detection of local quantum phases in 2D materials at the molecular-level precision. These research endeavors will open the door to an entirely new route to realizing strongly correlated systems based on molecular assemblies and will enable the high-spatial and temporal-precision detection of local static and dynamic quantum phase information using molecular messengers. The PI and graduate student from Brown will periodically visit BNL to perform and discuss the proposed experiments; BNL scientists will also visit Brown University to plan joint experiments and delivery seminar. These collaborative efforts will enable a sustainable collaboration between the two institutions beyond the award period.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
9,Collaborative Research: Multi-User Access to Sub-THz Spectrum,"To scale data rates in the face of rapidly growing application performance demands, next-generation wireless networks must provide efficient and low-latency access to the next spectrum frontier above 100 GHz. At such high frequencies, wider bandwidths will be available, enabling significantly higher data rates approaching terabits per second. Moreover, highly directive beams will be required to focus the transmission on the mobile user. This project provides two key building blocks for realizing such networks. First, this project will yield a rapid localization method so that highly directive transmissions can dynamically track mobile users. Second, this project will yield the first experimental network above 100 GHz in which an access point can simultaneously transmit to multiple mobile users. Such a multi-user capability is critical for realizing high data rates with low-latency access in dense user populations. One demonstration will be to simultaneously form signal spotlights to mobile users, adapting both the center and size of the spotlights according to the user mobility. <br/><br/>This project will demonstrate a sub-THz multi-user data-plane and control-plane via three integrated research thrusts, each of which includes implementation and experimental validation. The first project thrust will realize multi-user sub-THz spectrum access with a radically simplified architecture requiring no RF chains and no antenna arrays. The key technique is to dynamically reconfigure a transmissive metasurface with high-entropy wavefronts that yield different data symbols in different directions. Namely, off-line pre-characterization of the metasurface’s angular response will enable the metasurface itself to simultaneously generate multiple independent directional data streams. Designs will realize beamforming gains, angular symbol diversity, and robustness to client mobility. <br/>The second project thrust will realize multi-user spectrum access by generating custom-sized and shaped “spotlights” for each user. Exploiting the fact that the sub-THz near field can extend to tens of meters or more, the key technique is to reconfigure the metasurface’s meta-atoms to dynamically shape each user’s electromagnetic energy in space according to their location, mobility and potential interference, thereby enabling both robust and high-rate access. Spotlight shapes can be custom tailored to a user’s needs, even including curved trajectories to better support mobility around corners and to reduce inter-user interference. The third project thrust will realize a low-latency sub-THz control plane that yields high accuracy location and channel information. The key technique is for the access point to generate beacons with pre-characterized high-entropy wavefronts such that a small change in receiver position will yield a distinct spectral signature. The method enables one-shot localization and promises to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in both spatial resolution and time required. Consequently, it provides a key building block for realizing highly directional sub-THz access.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
10,AIMing:  Discovery through Machine Learning in Partial Differential Equations,"Recent advances in machine learning are demonstrating the potential to find solutions of challenging nonlinear partial differential equations which hold great significance in a variety of fields, including applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. Computer-assisted proofs are gaining momentum in this field, demonstrating their success in situations that have previously been out of reach using traditional approaches. By harnessing the synergy between mathematical principles and computational methods, the goal of this project is to unlock new mathematical insights, streamline computational processes, and push the boundaries of scientific exploration using novel machine learning approaches for understanding partial differential equations. Training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs is a fundamental component of this project, involving research questions that are rich and suitable for trainees. The investigator will also devote significant time to enhance and broaden participation in the mathematical community by organizing conferences, designing new courses and creating new programs, as well as contributing with open-source code to existing libraries such as mathlib or Arb.<br/><br/>This project has two complementary research goals. Machine-learning approaches will be developed for solving long standing open problems in (broadly defined) nonlinear partial differential equations, including dispersive, elliptic, and geometric frameworks. In complement, the project also intends to advance the heuristics behind machine-learning numerics for such equations, guided by new mathematical knowledge. This involves discovering and verifying new solutions to longstanding conjectures while at the same time improving on machine learning algorithms. This project is divided in four tasks: the first involves the incompressible Euler equation, the second addresses elliptic partial differential equations; the third studies geometric partial differential equations and Calabi-Yau metrics, and the fourth involves the development of mathlib and Lean code.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
11,Collaborative Research: NSF-BSF: State-dependent properties of co-transmitting neurons,"ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Nervous systems are biological communication networks that use signaling molecules called neurotransmitters to transfer information critical to every facet of brain function. “Bilingual” neurons are neurons that release two types of neurotransmitters to communicate with other neurons. Co-transmission allows the brain to fine-tune responses with multiple messages, which increases the functional flexibility of the brain, allowing it to accurately respond to a continually changing environment appropriately. The increasing number of examples of “bilingual” neurons found in the brains of animals from flies to humans indicates this is a fundamental mechanism by which neurons communicate. Despite this functional significance, there is still only limited insight into how co-transmission is regulated within neurons, and how the social environment impacts neuron communication. In this proposal, the investigators will use the fruit fly, Drosophila, to identify mechanisms that regulate co-transmission and identify how these mechanisms are dynamically regulated by the animal’s social environment, in both females and males. The outcomes of this work include an in-depth understanding of how multiple neurotransmitters generate behavioral flexibility, and separately provide a potential neuroprotective role in response to a social isolation environment. The project will provide research experience to students in diverse molecular and physiological techniques through international training and mentoring. In addition, each investigator will engage historically excluded groups in science at the University of Montana, Brown University, and Bar-Ilan University.<br/><br/>In this proposal, the investigators will leverage their deep understanding of behavior-promoting neurons, spatial transcriptomic approaches, and functional imaging to test the hypothesis that the molecular and physiological mechanisms that regulate co-transmission are themselves dynamically regulated by sex and state-dependent properties. The PIs will use cutting-edge techniques to examine how glutamate+/octopamine+ neurons in the Drosophila model system differ within a novel sex-specific context as well in response to state-dependent changes at the anatomical, transcriptomic and functional level. Specifically, the investigators will first address how the neural dynamics, neurotransmitter levels and distribution of glutamate and octopamine are impacted in the context of sexual dimorphism and the social isolation state. Second, they will identify transcriptional pathways that regulate glutamate or octopamine signaling through single nuclei RNA-seq and the spatial transcriptomics technology, Ex-seq. Laboratory settings are increasingly international and collaborative places, both in the university and in the global biotechnology industry. As a team the investigators are providing a collaborative and interactive training plan for their students to receive international instruction and mentoring, as well as learn new molecular and physiological techniques. Additional student education will occur through laboratory courses taught at Brown University and the University of Montana. Ultimately, this work will fill a large gap in our understanding of the regulation of co-transmission by identifying the rich assortment of communication capabilities that neurons possess in behaving animals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
12,RI: Medium: One vision: Computational alignment of deep neural networks with humans,"Rapid progress in artificial intelligence in recent years has been attributed to dramatic increases in the scale of deep neural networks (DNNs): DNNs have more parameters than ever before and are being trained on large proportions of the internet to acquire impressive, almost human-like visual abilities. However, even the largest, highest performing DNNs can fail in strange, inscrutable, and surprisingly “unhuman-like” ways, and this misalignment between humans and DNNs is worsening as DNNs grow in scale. This project aims to rectify the growing misalignment problem by designing the next generation of human-aligned DNNs capable of mimicking human behavior by relying on the computational, algorithmic, and representational principles that shape natural intelligence. The project will result in algorithms that behave like the human visual system, which are broadly applicable across computer vision, cognitive science, and neuroscience.<br/><br/>This project combines large-scale visual psychophysics to characterize human visual strategies and identify the computational principles underlying object recognition in humans with machine-learning methods to translate these insights into algorithms for aligning DNNs with humans. Data from human studies will first be combined with the recently developed “neural harmonizer” training algorithm to generate a large “zoo” of human-vision-aligned versions of publicly available DNNs. A differential analysis of neural circuits and representations in aligned versus standard DNNs will explain why today’s approaches to deep learning are misaligned with human brains. Finally, this project will build on the insights gained regarding the misalignment of DNNs and humans towards reverse engineering the data diets and objective functions needed to align DNNs with human vision from the outset. The proposed work will lead to significant advances in understanding of the perceptual and computational principles underlying human vision and the development of mathematical theories, computational tools, and learning approaches needed to inculcate artificial systems with those same principles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
13,Collaborative Research: SHF: Medium: A Scalable Graph-Based Approach to Clustering,"Clustering algorithms are one of the most important modern tools for understanding data. Given data on various entities, clustering algorithms group entities into sets or ""clusters"" such that similar entities are likely to end up in the same cluster while dissimilar entities tend to end up in different clusters. For example, clustering algorithms can be used to group images together according to the contents of the image. However, modern datasets are so large that many existing clustering algorithms cannot be feasibly used. This project aims to systematically address this situation by way of new clustering algorithms that scale to massive datasets with billions of entities. Clustering is widely used by scientists, companies, and government agencies. The toolkit developed in the project will be open-sourced and will make scalable, high-performance clustering more broadly accessible to scientists and practitioners by improving the efficiency and programming productivity of their clustering tasks. Results from the project will be integrated into courses that the investigators teach, and the researchers will recruit undergraduate students to participate in the project.<br/><br/>This three-institution collaborative project investigates a new approach for clustering pointsets by constructing sparse graphs that preserve relevant properties of the pointset. By carefully leveraging high-quality near-linear work graph clustering algorithms, very large datasets can be clustered in time that is nearly linear to the number of objects in the input with high accuracy. Particular attention will be paid to new algorithms for graph clustering and construction that utilize structure observed in practice, exploit parallelism, and enable dynamism with provable accuracy guarantees. A major contribution of the project will be an end-to-end clustering toolkit for graphs and pointsets that enables clustering to be scaled to inputs with billions of objects. The investigators will collaborate through regular remote meetings and seminars, student visits, joint publications, and annual in-person workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
14,CAIG: Navigating the Climate Science Deluge: Training Language Models to Assist in Comprehensive Assessments,"Reviewing and summarizing existing climate research results is critical for guiding future research and policy. The exponential growth of climate research literature makes working one paper at a time no longer efficient. The proposed work aims to discover new, more efficient ways to scour the scientific literature. This project will use artificial intelligence to build a climate science ""chat bot"" assistant. This assistant will be trained specifically for climate science literature. It will have the ability to independently read and report peer-reviewed papers. This will enable it to always include the latest peer-reviewed results published. It will help researchers review the literature more comprehensively and in less time. Improved assessment reports will contribute to better-informed climate policy.<br/><br/>Addressing the assessment bottleneck will accelerate climate research by better identifying the multiple lines of evidence needed to assess consensus and consistency. This project will also create fundamental advances in artificial intelligence through use-driven research in climate science. Current large language models often emphasize “chat bots” that address general topics. This project will develop new methods that can teach large language models specialized knowledge and skills without human intervention through large-scale data annotation efforts. These methods include synthetic training-data generation and interacting large language models. To improve huma interaction, the project will also develop methods for users to identify what types of inputs are difficult for the artificial intelligence to understand. By combining these new methods into an artificial intelligence assistant, the project will initiate a new approach to conducting comprehensive assessments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
15,Collaborative Research: An Exploration of Science Faculty Motivation in Providing Student Accommodations,"This project aims to serve the national interest by advancing our understanding of how universities nationwide can improve support for science faculty instructors in providing accommodations for students with disabilities in their classes. While the process of providing formal accommodations in higher education classrooms is initiated by students and coordinated typically by a disability or accessibility center, the actual implementation of accommodations is highly dependent on faculty instructors. Because faculty at different institutions have different responsibilities, resources, and student bodies, the context of providing accommodations likely varies greatly by the type of institution. Additional variables including rising numbers of students with disabilities and an increased use of active learning and hybrid/remote instruction inevitably influences a faculty instructor's experiences and willingness to provide accommodations to students with disabilities. By identifying and understanding the factors that impact faculty instructor motivation to provide accommodations, this project aims to elicit needed information on how to support science faculty instructors in meeting the needs of undergraduate students with disabilities.<br/><br/>This project plans to identify personal, institutional, and logistical factors that impact how science faculty instructors administer accommodations to students with disabilities. Because factors including class sizes, accessibility center resources, numbers of students who receive accommodations, faculty instructor responsibilities and expectations, and teaching support resources vary greatly by institution, this project will disaggregate findings by four different institution types (community colleges, primarily undergraduate institutions, comprehensive institutions, and research-intensive institutions). This project includes a nationwide interview study to identify how different factors impact a science faculty member's expected ability and value for the task of providing accommodations for students. To increase the generalizability of this work, the project plans to use findings from the interview study to inform development of three survey instruments, designed to measure science faculty's: (1) motivation to provide accommodations; (2) perceptions of the logistical, situational, and instrumental factors that impact student accommodations; and (2) personal knowledge of disability and accommodations. After instrument validation, the project plans to deploy the three survey instruments to science faculty at institutions nationwide. Data analysis will explore how different factors impact science faculty instructor's motivation and experiences with providing accommodations. Outcomes will be disseminated through publications, presentations, as well as videos, recorded talks and blog postings. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
16,Collaborative Research: FMitF: Track III: Proof assistants in discrete mathematics education,"Proof assistants---programming languages for the writing of mathematical proofs and interactive environments that check the correctness of proofs in these languages as users write them---have become increasingly user-friendly in the last two decades. It is now realistic to teach them to undergraduate students at the time of their first encounter with mathematical proofs. Since 2023, the investigators have taught discrete mathematics courses to computer science and mathematics undergraduates at Brown University and Fordham University using the proof assistant Lean; their course materials have already been adopted at several other institutions. This project’s novelties are the extension of these course materials to cover new topics, including combinatorics and probability; the development of infrastructure to allow other instructors more flexibility in reusing their materials; the creation and maintenance of an open repository of automation in Lean specialized to the needs of teaching; and the hosting of workshops for the sharing of ideas and the dissemination of best practices. The project’s impacts are that the cost of entry to teaching mathematics with a proof assistant is greatly lowered: many students, especially at institutions without formal methods expertise, will have access to tools that inform them of their errors and omissions in real time with a chance to correct them. These students will simultaneously gain experience with formal methods. <br/><br/>An essential part of teaching mathematics with a proof assistant is developing a controlled, limited language for interaction with a particular topic. To this end, the investigators are developing a library of pedagogical tactics. Some of these are domain-specific automation, while others are general-purpose or are variants of existing automation. The domain-specific tactics focus on combinatorics and probability, two subject areas that are not covered in the investigators’ previous course materials; alongside the tactics, the investigators are creating examples and exercises on these topics. The course materials are organized in a way that instructors can mix or reorder the topics covered with automated assistance and checks. Course infrastructure tools, including autograders and linters, are included in the work package and made openly available to other instructors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
17,Collaborative Research: CISE: Medium: Curving data around obstacles using sub-THz accelerating beams,"Wireless data traffic continues to grow at an exponential pace, demanding more and more bandwidth. Networks of the future will need to exploit frequencies above 100 gigahertz, which are much higher than what is typically employed today. These high frequencies need to propagate as narrow directional beams, rather than the wide- angle broadcasts currently used by base stations and cell towers. Using beams offers a number of important advantages, but also poses some significant challenges. One key challenge surrounds the question of how to adapt if the beam is blocked by an intervening obstruction between the transmitter and receiver, such as a person walking through the beam path. This research program explores a novel solution to this problem which relies on the generation of beams that follow a curved trajectory. Such beams can be generated in situations where the size of the transmitter is sufficiently large, with the appropriate engineering of the properties of the generated signal at all points across the emitting aperture. The use of such exotic beams in wireless communications is unprecedented, so many open questions must be explored in order to validate the feasibility. This work will open a new realm of possibilities for the implementation of local area networks operating at ultra-high frequencies. This project also includes a significant effort to broaden participation by under-represented groups, at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.<br/><br/>This research lays the foundations for the use of self-accelerating beams in mobile wireless local area networks (LANs) operating in the near-field regime. Since conventional link analysis cannot be applied in the near field of a transmitter, fundamental electromagnetic calculations are used to establish heuristic models for link budgets that can be employed to estimate the performance of such links, including a characterization of the effect of receiver aperture and of the near-field to far-field transition for various types of self-accelerating beams. Two different strategies are explored to create electrically reconfigurable metasurfaces that can be used to generate and manipulate such beams, which could be integrated into a transmitting base station for agile adaptation to transient blockage events. In addition, issues facing the control plane will also be explored, including the development of strategies for link discovery using beams with curved trajectories, and the implications of the asymmetry of the channel resulting from the fact that the receiver is in the near field of the transmitter but not vice versa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
18,Planning: CRISES: A Center on Clean Energy and Society,"This project supports planning for a new Center on Clean Energy and Society (CES). The goal of the project is to investigate the social, political, and behavioral processes relevant to scaling up clean energy infrastructure in the United States and around the world. The planning grant supports organizational activities over a two-year period including interdisciplinary meetings to identify key research on the societal aspects of clean energy development; a synthesis of existing research on clean energy and society; and an outreach meeting with relevant stakeholders. The approval of solar and wind energy projects is a complicated process involving numerous actors and stakeholders at a range of spatial scales. Institutional factors play an especially key role in energy infrastructure development. This planning project supports the development of a human-centered approach to the reliable, affordable, equitable, and effective solutions needed for clean energy development. <br/><br/>This project investigates the social and institutional processes of clean energy development. The research project particularly investigates under what conditions does support for a clean energy economy materialize, and whether clean energy development boosts community resilience, energy reliability, and national security. The benefits and the costs of rolling out clean energy fall unequally to different people along lines of income and racial diversity. The proposed CES Center addresses these challenges, and the organizational activities supported by this planning grant lay the groundwork for a broader research program tackling these questions. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to generate knowledge to understand the complex mechanisms grounding the societal dimensions of clean energy development. This involves identifying various social, political, and institutional barriers to clean energy and assessing the effectiveness of various strategies to surmount those barriers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
19,Collaborative Research: EDGE FGT: In vivo and in vitro Tools for the Community of Echinoderm Researchers,"Everything in biology is connected. Our job as life scientists is to reveal important biological properties in the most impactful, efficient, and economical way. To do so we look for model organisms that are particularly tractable for studying complex biological processes and then apply what we learn to better understand other organisms. For more than a century, sea urchins have provided a valuable research model that has contributed significantly to our understanding of many fundamental biological processes such as fertilization, embryonic development, and cell division. Sea urchins have proven to be a valuable model due to their close genetic relationship to vertebrate animals and many features that make experimentation easier. The goal of this proposal is to create the next generation of tools to enhance the utility of sea urchins as research models that will enable new areas of research and to make these tools widely available to the scientific community. Areas of biological research to be enhanced by the tools created from this proposal include a better understanding of how eggs and sperm interact at fertilization, understanding the rules of embryo development, how nerve cells are made, how sex is determined, how animals protect themselves from environmental insults and from infection, and how tissues and organs can regenerate when they are damaged. The outcomes of this proposal will reach far beyond the scientists, to the public, students and teachers and make the sea urchin a highly attractive and impactful research and education tool of the twenty-first century.<br/> <br/>Sea urchin researchers have long sought to leverage the experimental tractability of the embryo and adult with genetic approaches but, to date, manipulations have been limited largely to dependence on morpholinos or pharmacology. The overarching goal of this EDGE proposal is to build tools that overcome major obstacles to testing gene functionality in echinoderms, opening up a new era of discovery for diverse and integrated studies across all life history stages of this valuable sister group to chordates. This goal will be realized as follows: (1) Simple and efficient protocols for culturing cells from embryos to investigate gene function in vitro; (2) Rapid, scalable DNA transfection of embryos, adult tissues, and cell cultures for conditional, and reversible gene control; (3) Techniques to promote standardization of sea urchin husbandry with open hardware and cryopreservation for sea urchin germplasm and cell lines; (4) Virtual, interactive educational materials to reach secondary school and undergraduate students and investigators learning from and even considering entering this research community. These integrated new technologies with controlled and heritable genetic manipulations and the ability to test gene function and regulation in in vitro cell-based systems will enable new avenues of investigation that fully exploit the important properties of echinoderms as a research organism. The tools developed in this proposal will remove the bottlenecks and provide scalable and sustainable resources for the community of echinoderm researchers.<br/><br/>The proposal was funded by the Enabling Discovery through GEnomics (EDGE) program and the Developmental Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
20,Collaborative Research: Mechanics of Elastomers Tailored by Cation-Pi Interactions,"Soft materials underpin important technologies such as adhesives, coatings, drug delivery, and energy storage. One key challenge with such materials is how they change when exposed to fluids, especially if these fluids contain dissolved salts (e.g., seawater, bodily fluids, or battery electrolytes). Soft materials will often dissolve, detach, or excessively swell in salty fluids, leading to their failure. This award supports research into a new class of soft materials designed for salty fluid environments. The influence of molecular scale design on the mechanical properties of these materials will be investigated. The resulting fundamental knowledge will provide a foundation for adhesives or structures that strengthen in environments such as seawater; components that aggregate in response to specific salt species, enhancing desalination plants; and as salt driven muscle-like components for soft robotics. This award will also result in the interdisciplinary education of students in New York and Rhode Island in mechanical engineering and chemical sciences. <br/><br/>A novel zipper-like molecular topology of soft polymeric materials decorated with tethered cationic and aromatic groups, termed ZIPers, will be investigated. These materials are simple to prepare on large scale and preliminary data shows that these ZIPers have a complex dependence of equilibrium structure and mechanical properties on the concentration and type of anion present in solution, features that can be dynamically adjusted by changes in ionic content. This work will utilize a combination of synthetic, experimental, and modeling approaches to provide insight into three aspects of their mechanical behavior: (1) the equilibrium structures and corresponding small strain oscillatory response of the ZIPer system as a function of monomer ratio, salt type, and salt concentration; (2) how the structure and crosslink dynamics determine the time dependent large deformation mechanical response of the ZIPer system; (3) potential of the ZIPer system to exhibit salt-driven shape-morphing. New mesoscale and continuum polymer modeling techniques will enable this work and also be standalone contributions to the mechanics of polymers field. This project will advance knowledge of the mechanics of dynamically bonded polymers and provide key insights into the properties of dynamic and responsive soft materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
21,IRES: Neurobiological basis of elaborate display evolution in frogs endemic to the Asian tropics,"The signals that animals use to communicate with each other are critical to life, mediating a wide range of social interactions that determine whether individuals live or die, find mates, and compete for opportunities to breed. One of the most spectacular features of animal signals is that they are remarkably diverse, with each species appearing to evolve its own unique set of ornaments and displays. Understanding how these different signals evolve and diversify is a longstanding goal of organismal biology, yet this topic remains mysterious in several ways. We know, for example, very little about how the brain influences the process of social signal evolution. In this IRES project, undergraduate students from around the U.S. will be trained to conduct research that addresses this major knowledge gap. Student participants work with a group of international PIs, who together use integrative approaches to study the evolution and control of animal communication behavior. Study locations include Austria and India, where participants work for a 10-week period during the summer. Research activities center around both laboratory and field experiments that are performed in groups and through independent research projects. Their experience abroad is bookended by pre- and post-travel training to help prepare the participants with appropriate technical and cultural acumen to successfully complete their projects. Students also receive professional development throughout the entire experience, and they will work throughout the summer to help construct conservation exhibits for the local zoo in Vienna, Austria. In this way, the program focuses not only on building research and outreach skills, but also cultivating international proficiency and awareness. Our program fulfills the goals of the IRES program by producing college graduates who are ready to join the global STEM workforce in the 21st century.<br/><br/>International collaboration is a critical part of ecology and evolutionary biology, driving major discoveries about the principles of life on Earth. Yet, undergraduate students from the U.S. often encounter hurdles that prevent them from engaging in such collaborative research. This is a problem because it means that our undergraduate population may be underprepared to join the modern STEM workforce, particularly in areas of ecology and evolution. The current research project aims to develop a program that addresses this problem by annually involving 6 undergraduate students from around the US and 1 graduate student in mentored research projects in both Austria and India. The program will last 10 weeks in the summer, and student participants will conduct work that explores how neural systems influence the evolution of elaborate visual displays in frogs. Students will work independently, as well as in large teams, to investigate: 1) how adaptive cognitive traits drive display evolution, and 2) how motor circuits in the spinal cord co-evolve with display diversification. All work will be done in the laboratory and field alongside mentors from the host countries. Thus, student participants are given the chance to not only address fundamental questions in animal communication, but to do so in an international context that helps prepare them for STEM careers in a global landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
22,"CAREER: Interpolation, stability, and rationality","This project develops techniques to understand the geometry of the solutions to systems of polynomial equations. Of particular interest is when the set of solutions are one-dimensional, in which case it is called an algebraic curve. Since polynomials are ubiquitous in science and engineering, such solution sets arise in many different contexts. One important example is the interpolation problem: given a collection of general points, when is there a fixed type of algebraic curve passing through these points? This problem has applications to cryptography and information theory. The research projects will shed light on the possible realizations of an algebraic curve by polynomial equations, as well as new and important cases of the interpolation problem. This will be complemented by educational and outreach activities, including a sequence of workshops designed for early-to-mid career women and nonbinary graduate students in algebraic geometry and mentoring undergraduate research.<br/><br/>More specifically, the research projects are in the following three directions. The first focuses on the natural stratification of the space of vector bundles on a curve equipped with a fixed dominant map to another curve by the stability of the pushforward. The second focuses on the interpolation problem in other settings, including when the ambient variety is a homogeneous space. The last focuses on the rationality problem for varieties over nonclosed ground fields, and in particular upon generalizations of the intermediate Jacobian torsor obstruction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
23,Variational methods in singular geometry,"Many physical phenomena can be described by the principle of least action. This involves studying minima of certain functionals, called Lagrangians, named after the French mathematician and astronomer J-L Lagrange (1736-1813), that describe the energy of the system under consideration. For example, it is possible to derive Newton's laws of classical mechanics from the principle of least action. The principle can be applied also to more complicated systems, even infinite dimensional configuration spaces. One famous such example is the case of geodesics, paths minimizing the distance between two points in a smooth space. Another, more involved example is the case of harmonic maps. Here the Lagrangian energy is the total stretch of a map between two smooth spaces. In this project the PI proposes to study analogous situations for more complicated Lagrangians that have important applications. The project has also an educational component where the PI is planning to supervise graduate students towards their Ph.D. theses, undergraduates through seminar courses, and write expository notes for a wider audience.<br/> <br/>In slightly more technical terms, harmonic maps are critical points of the L-2 norm of the gradient (Dirichlet integral) of a map between two Riemannian manifolds. The PI proposes to study the calculus of variations of functionals associated with other function space norms like the L-infinity and L-1 norms. Minimizing functionals associated to the L-infinity norm yield solutions of fully non-linear degenerate elliptic PDE’s with very challenging regularity properties. Similarly, solutions of the dual non-linear problem for functionals involving the L-1 norm are equally challenging. The singular sets of these solutions provide geometric realizations of topological objects, like geodesic foliations and laminations, studied in topology. The PI proposes to develop the analytic methods to study these topological objects as well as others studied in Thurston theory. Examples are earthquakes and cataclysms. There is very little known in the literature about the analytic underpinnings of the theory so the PI has to develop most of the techniques from scratch.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
24,As If vs. Substantive Rationality: Identification and Implications,"Economic decision makers face an important constraint: while they need to know consumer preferences to identify welfare improvements, they can only observe choices made. Hence, welfare economics and its resulting implications rest heavily on the idea that choices are driven by one’s preferences. Under the classic model of rationality, a consumer has a stable preference over alternatives and systematically uses it to choose the best affordable option. Because neither decision process nor preference are observable, economists have had to content themselves with choices that, to the naked eye, are consistent with rational behavior under some preference. Choices look “as if they are rational” when, taken altogether, they do not lead to contradictory inferences about preferences (for an example of such a contradiction, imagine selecting option A when option B is affordable under some prices, but switching to option B when A remains affordable under some other prices). Comfortingly, a rich experimental literature establishes the prevalence of as-if rationality in a variety of economic contexts. It may seem natural to presume that as-if rationality is tightly coupled with the use of a rational decision process. The current research challenges this presumption. The researchers use a novel experimental design to show that even when experimental participants fail to maximize their welfare, they tend to use coherent decision rules, or choice procedures, that mimic properties of rational behavior. The ability to disentangle as-if rationality (which may be driven by rules of thumb or heuristics) from truly (i.e., substantively) rational behavior rationality has many important implications that this research investigates. For instance, given prior work establishing that as-if rationality correlates with wealth, is it substantive rationality or heuristic behavior that drives the correlation? Does heuristic behavior disappear given feedback and time to learn? Is the prevalence of substantive rationality responsive to the complexity of a decision problem? This research will also investigate multiple important questions arising in a society with some seemingly-rational consumers. These include how to aggregate choices, elect leaders, and minimize price distortions in markets.<br/><br/>The experimental literature has documented, using various metrics of compliance with the General Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP), that subjects tend to be highly as-if rational. Yet what drives this GARP compliance is unknown: there is an indeterminate relationship between the subject's welfare and the utility function(s) which seem to capture choices in these experiments. The researchers introduce a novel experimental design that pairs traditional experiments measuring subjects' natural preferences (i.e., their true preferences for risk, time, etc.) with isomorphic experiments that instead induce canonical preferences. Presuming only that money is desirable, this approach removes scope for subjects to rationally express unobserved ``home grown'' preferences: the utility-maximizing choice is the optimal demand under the induced preference. The initial finding, which is robust to multiple metrics of assessing substantive rationality, is that the majority of as-if rational subjects use suboptimal simplifying heuristics which only mimic rational demands. The researchers will extend and deploy this new experimental approach to address multiple questions on the nature and extent of this distinction. Do people become more procedurally rational in complex problems? Does procedural rationality correlate with classic behavioral biases? Which forms of rationality vary with experience? How do different forms of rationality correlate with socio-economic variables? The researchers will also experimentally investigate key questions relating to group rationality and the aggregation of choices. Is the pivotal agent in group decisions substantively rational? Are prices distorted in the presence of procedurally-rational agents, thereby impacting everyone’s welfare (including those who are substantively rational)? Does the fraction of substantively-rational choices decrease in strategic voting if being pivotal is unlikely? Do voters recognize and value candidates’ degrees of rationality? What becomes of the Coase theorem when bargainers fail to be substantively rational? The results have the potential to profoundly change how economists envision welfare economics, and to make significant contributions in applications to general equilibrium, strategic voting, and bargaining.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
25,Compactifications of moduli spaces and their tropicalizations,"Algebraic geometry is the study of spaces that can be described as solution sets of systems of polynomial equations. Circles, parabolae, and hyperbolae are all examples, from classical plane geometry, of shapes which are governed by defining polynomials, in these cases polynomials in two variables. In algebraic geometry, the deep connection between algebra (the defining polynomials) and geometry (the resulting shape) is key. Both recently and over the past century, a large effort has been focused on the study of some very particular spaces of long-standing interest, called moduli spaces, of curves and abelian varieties. These are parameter spaces for certain kinds of geometric objects, and they have deep connections throughout geometry, as well as to mathematical physics and combinatorics. This project will develop and employ modern techniques to make new progress on the study of such spaces. The project will also provide research training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>This research program is centered on compactifications of moduli spaces and their tropicalizations, i.e., the instantiations of these moduli spaces in the field of tropical geometry. The project uses tropical moduli spaces, which are certain polyhedral complexes, as a geometric instantiation of the boundary combinatorics of an appropriately compactified moduli space. The existence of the tropical space allows the application of combinatorial-geometric techniques, as well as connections to the study of the cohomology of arithmetic groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
26,Investigating the crust and uppermost mantle beneath volcanoes with new seismic analyses,"Volcanic eruptions connect the Earth’s deep interior with its surface and atmosphere, and they have wide-ranging effects. As natural hazards, eruptions pose risks to human lives, infrastructure, and economies. Magma in the crust provides a favorable environment for development of geothermal energy systems. Gases, like carbon dioxide, and tiny particles released into the atmosphere by volcanoes can affect weather and climate. Therefore, there is a need to understand how magma forms, ascends to the surface, and erupts. This project is studying how and where magma is currently being stored in the deep crust under three recently active volcanoes: Yellowstone and the Cascades Arc in North America, and the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex in South America. The project is measuring the speed of seismic waves, which were generated by distant earthquakes, as they travel beneath the volcanoes. The speed of seismic waves is sensitive to the abundance of magma and whether it is stored in flat horizontal layers or tall vertical columns. A key outcome of the project will be to advance knowledge of how the storage and migration of magma affect the eruptibility of volcanoes. A second important outcome is the research training of one graduate student and two undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Mapping the distribution of melt in the crust and upper mantle is a long-standing goal in the Earth sciences that bears on a wide range of scientific and societal issues. One such issue is how the storage and migration of magma affect the eruptibility of volcanoes. There is emerging consensus that the magmatic system beneath active volcanoes spans the entire crust. However, in volcanic settings, there are large error bars on crustal melt-fraction estimates, and the depth distribution of melt is challenging to resolve, especially in the lower crust. This project is studying the crustal architecture beneath active volcanoes with two types of seismic analyses that have thus far been rarely used in these settings. One is radial anisotropy as estimated from intermediate-period (25-75 s) surface waves from teleseismic earthquakes, which provides constraints on the lower crust and uppermost mantle that complement the more commonly used ambient-noise studies. The other is Rayleigh wave amplification, which is sensitive to P-wave and S-wave speed in the lower crust and uppermost mantle. The VP/VS ratio depends only weakly on temperature but is strongly sensitive to melt. These new data sets will be jointly inverted together with Rayleigh wave phase velocities from ambient noise and teleseismic earthquakes and Love wave phase velocities from ambient noise to produce depth-dependent models for VS, VP/VS, and radial anisotropy for three volcanic regions: Yellowstone and the Cascades Arc in North America, and the Altiplano-Puna Volcanic Complex in South America.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
27,"Collaborative Research: NSF-SNSF: Discontinuous Galerkin Methods on Cube-Sphere Mesh, Optimized for Long Time, Exascale, Structure-Preserving Simulations","Interpreting many of the results from astronomical observatories requires numerical simulations, often run on supercomputers. These include dynamical radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with algorithmic innovations, many of which are not currently in hand. Many of these innovations can be described as structure-preserving; in other words. there is physics in the numerical partial differential equations (PDEs) that has to be mimicked at a discrete level in codes that are optimized for spherical geometry. Our current capabilities for computational astrophysics are deficient because the relevant applied mathematics has not been developed for solving these problems. A research collaboration between the University of Notre Dame, Brown University and ETH Zürich in Switzerland will work together to overcome some of these deficiencies by making targeted advances in applied mathematics, which would be transformative in how they enable unprecedentedly novel astrophysical simulations that help in the interpretation of valuable observational data. The students and postdocs trained in this project will find many fertile career trajectories in astrophysics, applied math, and other fields such as plasma physics. The PI also runs an after-school remedial math program for students in the Gary, Indiana area who have fallen far behind in their math education.<br/><br/>The applied mathematics challenges come in three parts: 1) We need high order divergence-preserving methods for capturing MHD turbulence that occurs in the vicinity of massive stellar winds. 2) We need multigroup radiation hydrodynamics 3) For long-term, high-fidelity, simulation of planetary atmospheres, we need well-balanced methods that are implicit in the radial direction and can preserve angular momentum. To overcome deficiencies in current astrophysical codes, the team will develop: 1) Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods with non-oscillatory design and a capability for preserving geometrical conservation laws (GCL) 2) Divergence-free DG methods that can operate on geometrically complex cube sphere meshes. 3) An efficient multi-group method for radiation hydrodynamics based on DG schemes. 4) Well-balanced DG schemes that are implicit in the radial direction so that very thin zones in the radial direction can be handled. 5) DG schemes that are angular momentum preserving. The MHD and radiation hydrodynamics innovations will also find engineering applications in fields as plasma-based space propulsion and in simulating the physics of tokamaks.<br/><br/>This collaborative U.S.-Swiss project is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF), where NSF funds the U.S. investigator and SNSF funds the partners in Switzerland.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
28,Dynamic Catalysts for Sulfur Atom Transfer Reactions,"With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Eunsuk Kim of Brown University will study new ways to manipulate sulfur in chemical reactions. Sulfur compounds are among the most common and problematic impurities found in crude oil. Their removal is a crucial step in the refining process, necessary to prevent the generation of environmentally harmful products during petroleum combustion, which consumes considerable energy and resources. Conversely, sulfur is a prevalent element in many FDA-approved drugs, highlighting its value in organic synthesis. The project will focus on developing a new class of catalysts capable of efficiently inserting sulfur into molecules or removing it without damaging the remaining parts. It will also train the next generation of scientists, and foster collaboration across different areas of chemistry. Participants will gain valuable research experience applicable to the energy and pharmaceutical industries. Moreover, the program will promote diversity in STEM fields through mentoring underrepresented minorities and female scientists and creating educational materials to inspire future generations.<br/><br/>This project will develop a novel class of responsive sulfur atom transfer (SAT) catalysts that are oxidatively stable and have self-repairing capabilities during catalysis. Two groups of molybdenum-containing catalysts, supported by tridentate and tetradentate ligands, will be systematically synthesized, and their catalytic activities will be compared. The reaction mechanisms will also be investigated. The first group of catalysts, supported by a tridentate ligand frame, is responsive, activating only when suitable substrates are present. The second group, supported by a tetradentate ligand frame, exists in equilibrium between active and dormant forms. The presence or absence of the substrate can shift this equilibrium, functioning like a buffer system. In both cases, unintentionally oxidized catalysts can be regenerated in situ via oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactions, owing to the catalysts’ unique dual catalytic capability for both OAT and SAT. The catalysts developed from this project will be air-stable and effective under mild conditions, creating an immediate impact in the field of synthetic chemistry. The findings will also have broad applications in both the petroleum and pharmaceutical industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
29,Accurate Determination of Branching Fractions in Ammonia Combustion,"Ammonia is a potential bridge fuel for carbon-neutral combustion. However, the combustion of ammonia can lead to various nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are major pollutants, and which can exacerbate climate change. To mitigate the impact of NOx on human health and the environment, government regulations increasingly require reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides from combustion sources. The ability to make accurate predictions of NOx formation levels will benefit engineers and scientists who need to quantify the impact of a new fuel or a new engine design on NOx emissions. These NOx submechanisms also will benefit the broader atmospheric science community, both at the local level (e.g. smog) and at the global level (e.g. climate change). <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to measure the branching fractions for several reactions that are important in the kinetics of ammonia combustion, particularly those related to various nitrogen oxides. The investigators hypothesize that by measuring the transient concentration of two or more species simultaneously, the uncertainty in the branching fractions can be reduced relative to the current state of the art in NOx literature. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will use tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) to measure the transient concentration of NO, NO2, N2O, H2O, and/or temperature behind the reflected shock in a shock tube. These profiles will serve as validation targets for a kinetic model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
30,Collaborative Research: Bridging geoscience and engineering to interrogate seismic cycle processes in the earthquake critical zone,"Large earthquakes have the potential to have catastrophic impacts on humans and infrastructure when risks are not mitigated. Earthquakes nucleate at depth, but it is the upper ~1 km of a fault zone where seismic waves, rocks and sediments, fluids, humans, and their built environment intersect to drive earthquake hazard. This is the critical zone for earthquakes. This Frontier Research in Earth Sciences (FRES) project investigates how material properties that vary in space and time in the earthquake critical zone impact earthquake rupture propagation, radiation of seismic waves, ground shaking intensity, and surface deformation in between earthquakes. This research targets two similar faults, each with significant human impact, that are at different points in their earthquake cycle: the southern San Andreas fault, CA, in a quiet period between earthquakes, and the Çardak-Çığlık fault, Turkey, in the immediate aftermath of the 6 February 2023 Mw 7.6 Elbistan earthquake, part of the devastating Kahramanmaraş earthquake sequence. The research team will bridge geoscience and engineering concepts, approaches, data, and models, as well as leverage shared-use equipment and cyber-infrastructure, to deliver publicly available products on the NSF-funded Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure DesignSafe Data Depot that can improve earthquake hazard models and seismic site response analyses near seismogenic faults, which are needed for increased resilience of communities to earthquakes. Research and broader impacts are anchored in intellectual, educational, and cultural reciprocity to broaden STEM knowledge, perspectives, and participation. Research pathways will meaningfully intersect by training the next generation of Earth scientists at the nexus of geosciences and engineering, strengthening international partnerships with Turkish colleagues, and expanding the Utah State University (USU) Native American Student Mentoring Program through geoscience-engineering research experiences to increase the transition rate of Native American students from a 2-year campus at USU Blanding, UT, to the 4-year campus in Logan, UT.<br/><br/>This FRES project investigates how the earthquake critical zone accumulates, redistributes, and releases earthquake energy on major strike-slip faults. Models of earthquake rupture, seismic wave propagation, and local surface ground shaking are commonly decoupled and limited because the detailed properties of the earthquake critical zone are generalized. This FRES research will overcome these limitations by characterizing the earthquake critical zone of two major continental strike-slip faults with five intersecting research pathways that will yield geologic, geophysical, geochemical, mechanical, and engineering data. The pathways are: (1) a field-based geologic framework, (2) time-series CO2 flux data, a proxy for fault permeability and healing, (3) in-situ earthquake engineering geophysics to characterize material moduli, attenuation, and fault architecture, (4) deformation experiments to quantify fault healing, permeability, and attenuation at conditions designed to inform different stages of a seismic cycle, and (5) geochemical, microstructural, and fault rock chronology analyses to bridge natural and experimental earthquake cycle processes. These datasets will be integrated in a sixth pathway to produce stacked quasi-static, dynamic, and seismic site response numerical models. Research and broader impact activities bring together six PIs with diverse but overlapping geoscience and engineering expertise to train the next generation of Earth scientists at the intersection of these fields (three postdoctoral fellows, four PhD students, one MSc student, and undergraduate researchers). Undergraduate researchers will be recruited through the USU Honors Program, a Brown REU, and California State University Fullerton (CSUF) Project RAISE, which all focus on recruiting students underrepresented in the geosciences. International partnerships will be strengthened by having two Turkish colleagues participate in field work along the SSAF and lead Turkey-based research and by having US-based researchers connect with Turkish counterparts at public seminars at Istanbul Technical University. PIs and mentees will create and offer a new multi-year program to expand the USU-based Native American Student Mentoring Program with a goal to improve recruitment and retention of Native American students. These students will be hosted at PI labs at USU Logan, with help from Brown and CSUF researchers, where they will be taught earthquake and engineering concepts, and subsequently be taken to the south San Andreas fault for field work. Their progress will be tracked and assessed by evaluating learning outcomes and STEM engagement through these experiences. This project is funded by the Frontier Research in Earth Science (FRES) program as well as Education and Human Resources (EHR) in support of Research Experiences for Undergraduates and Postdoctoral Scholars.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
31,EAGER: Establish a New Paradigm in SOFC/SOEC Surface Segregation Modeling,"This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project conceives and studies a novel computational approach to predicting the surface composition of solid oxide electrochemical devices under long-term use in energy related chemical applications. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), in particular, are amongst the most energy-efficient devices available for generating electrical energy. Both SOFC and related solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) technology are positioned to play an important role in the transition to net-zero carbon emissions. However, the devices operate at high temperature, which over time in service can lead to degradation in structural stability and performance. The project will link theoretical and experimental approaches to better understand the degradation mechanisms of solid oxide exchange catalysts, and use the resultant insights to predict more stable, and better performing materials compositions than currently available. <br/><br/>The project will support computational analysis to develop refined predictive models of oxide dopant surface-segregation of strontium (Sr) in ABO3 perovskites under electrical conditions characteristic of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC), and reversible Solid Oxide Cell (rSOC) devices. The study is motivated by the fact that past studies have primarily relied on the size and/or charge mismatch between a dopant ion, and the host ion it is replacing, to capture the driving force for dopant segregation out of bulk perovskite lattice structures. However, such predictions are in direct opposition to recently published experimental observations showing that - while there is significant Sr surface segregation in La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.2Co0.8O3-x (LSCF) and La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Co0.2O3-x during 1000 hours of 650-700oC open-circuit aging in air - there is little to no Sr surface segregation in Sm0.5Sr0.5CoO3-x (SSC) exposed to identical testing conditions. Those observations have triggered follow-on collaborative work by the investigators indicating, by both experimental and theoretical (i.e., Surface Gibbs Free Energy (SGFE)) analyses, that this is because LSCF is largely Sr-terminated under SOC operating conditions, whereas the SSC surface remains largely Co-terminated. However, SGFE phase diagrams are needed for various members of the (La,Sr,Sm)(Fe,Co)O3-x solid solution family, under an assortment of likely SOFC/SO polarizations, to refine surface segregation predictions and extend them to relevant SOFC/SOE/rSOCs operating conditions. To that end, the investigators will work hand-in-hand to 1) produce DFT-computed SGFE diagrams on a range of (La,Sm,Sr)(Fe,Co)O3-x compositions as a function of temperature (𝑇), oxygen partial pressure (𝑝𝑂2 𝐺𝑎𝑠), and overpotential (𝜂), and 2) compare the predicted results to experimental characterization of the surface structure and oxygen exchange performance obtained at various 𝑇, 𝑝𝑂2 𝐺𝑎𝑠 and 𝜂 conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
32,"Collaborative Research: CDS&E: Data-Driven Discovery of Neural ODE Dynamics, Astrophysical Models, and Orbits (Neural ODE DynAMO)","Scientists recently detected gravitational waves from black holes and neutron stars orbiting each other. These waves, which were first predicted by Albert Einstein, are like ripples in space-time created by the movement of massive objects in distant galaxies. Current models of these gravitational waves focus on two-body systems, like a pair of black holes or neutron stars orbiting each other, without considering the effects of their astrophysical environments. The main scientific challenge is incorporating these complex environmental interactions into the models. This award will fund an interdisciplinary team from multiple institutions to use new machine learning advancements to tackle these challenges. The resulting models and machine learning techniques will allow researchers to study powerful collisions of binary black holes in extreme environments. Moreover, this research project will engage the public through outreach activities and train diverse students with strong backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and math, preparing them for careers requiring technical and computational skills. <br/><br/>This research team's previous work introduced gravitational waveform inversion (GWI), a machine-learning technique for discovering orbital models from gravitational waveform data without environmental effects. The current project aims to advance GWI by incorporating environmental effects to discover new, detailed physical models. To this end, the team will develop specific models for dark matter halos and disc-embedded extreme mass ratio inspiral systems. The team will also focus on connecting their models to observations by interfacing with – and contributing to – open-source projects such as PyCBC and the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit. This new approach could unlock the full potential of upcoming gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA, revealing precise information about binary black hole systems and their host environments. This award advances the goals of the NSF Windows on the Universe Big Idea through research in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
33,Stochastic Nash Evolution,"This project develops a new framework for the Nash embedding theorems in order to align the foundations of mathematics with cutting edge scientific applications, especially in AI. In the 1950s, Nash amazed the mathematical world by unifying two distinct ways of thinking about space. In two papers, he established that an abstractly defined space with a notion of length (an intrinsic Riemannian manifold) can be realized as the solution of a system of nonlinear differential equations (an extrinsic embedded manifold). These theorems are strikingly original. For example, a counterintuitive conclusion is that it is possible to crumple the surface of the globe into an arbitrarily small region without any change in length. In a remarkable development in the past decade, these theorems are now known to lie at the foundation of outstanding scientific challenges, especially the description of turbulence in fluids and the description of big data with deep learning. This project tackles both theory and practice. On one hand, a rigorous mathematical framework is developed for the Nash embedding theorems using probability theory, shedding new light on the underlying concepts and techniques. On the other hand, algorithms and models are developed that align the theory with scientific applications. The project contributes to the training of personnel in STEM fields through the mentoring of Ph.D students.<br/><br/>The technical core of this project is the rigorous analysis of Riemannian Langevin equations (RLE). The RLE provides a unified model in geometric deep learning, random matrix theory, and the isometric embedding problem (and related nonlinear PDE). In each setting, the goal of this project is to rigorously construct Gibbs measures in tandem with the development of fast optimization and sampling algorithms. Regarding mathematical foundations, the primary focus is on new intrinsic constructions of Brownian motion on Riemannian manifolds and the construction of stochastic flows with critical regularity. This framework is then extended to turbulence and other h-principles in PDE, replacing Nash's iterative scheme with RLE in each case. Matrix models, especially the deep linear network (DLN), provide the bridge between geometry and algorithms. On one hand, the Riemannian geometry of DLN is used to guide the analysis of (nonlinear) deep learning. On the other hand, the use of stochastic gradient descent is used to develop numerical schemes for sampling Gibbs measures for nonlinear PDE.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
34,New Physics Signatures in Cosmological Observations,"This award funds the research activities of Professor Savvas M. Koushiappas at Brown University.<br/><br/>Despite exciting experimental progress over the last two decades, several problems remain and new ones have appeared with the increased precision of cosmological experiments. The nature of dark matter and dark energy remain elusive, the distribution of dark matter in halos may hint to physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, and the search for quantum gravity remains an open question. New physics is necessitated to address these questions. The award bridges the gap between cosmology, particle physics, and astrophysics, and is in line with the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws. The projects in this award have also significant broader impacts. Professor Koushiappas will involve graduate students in his research and provide critical training for junior scientists in a STEM field. In addition, he will present public lectures on contemporary topics in cosmology as well as develop new courses that stem from the results of this research.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Koushiappas will explore the effects of ultra-light dark matter in the accumulation of angular momentum in galactic systems. Angular momentum in dark matter halos is built-up in the linear and quasi-linear regime from the coupling between the mass distribution of the dark matter halo and the mass distribution of the neighboring density fluctuation field. Ultra-light dark matter has a different mass distribution compared to cold dark matter. This award will explore the effects of ultra-light dark matter in the angular momentum content of dark matter halos, with the goal of using current and future observables as constraints on the nature of dark matter. In addition, this award will investigate new possible interactions between dark matter and collision-less particles (stars and black holes) in dark matter dominated systems. Furthermore, work under this award will search for imprints quantum and/or modified gravity on cosmological observations through the growth of structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

36,"Asymptotic Phenomena in Reaction-Diffusion, Stochastic, and Fluid Equations","Many biological and physical systems exhibit high degrees of internal complexity that resist direct mathematical description. Examples include ecological dynamics in a varied environment and fluctuating flame fronts in combustion. Nonetheless, such systems often exhibit tractable behavior when viewed at large or fine scales. This ""asymptotic"" behavior plays a major role in applications, and often has a universal character that unites the study of disparate systems. In this project, the principal investigator (PI) will combine several mathematical methods to identify and justify asymptotic phenomena in partial differential equations (PDEs) originating in the sciences. This work has the potential to shed light on a variety of systems including ecological invasion, atomic deposition, and fluid shock formation. The PI is committed to undergraduate and graduate mentorship, with the particular aim of supporting students from underrepresented backgrounds. <br/><br/>This project will explore the asymptotic behavior of various deterministic and stochastic PDEs in significant limiting regimes. The project comprises three interconnected lines of work. (1) The PI will study the long-time propagation speed and front structure of solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in heterogeneous and random environments. This investigation encompasses a dual analysis of associated branching particle systems. (2) The PI will combine analytic and probabilistic methods to study long-time and white-noise limits of several physically motivated stochastic PDEs, including stochastic conservation laws and stochastic heat equations near criticality. (3) The PI will investigate the action of weak viscosity on internal shock formation in the compressible Navier--Stokes equations. This involves a delicate coupling between hyperbolic and parabolic approximations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
37,Cooperation in Context: Biotic and abiotic drivers of interaction outcome in cleaner shrimp-client fish mutualisms,"Determining when, and with whom, to cooperate, is a central challenge for many organisms. Even when cooperation seems the obvious outcome—as in mutualisms, interactions between species where cooperation results in benefits to each party—huge variation is seen in the outcome of an interaction. However, there are major knowledge gaps in our understanding of why this variation exists. This project explores these knowledge gaps in cleaning mutualisms in which cleaner shrimp, which live in groups at “cleaning stations,” remove and eat parasites from their reef fish “clients.” Specifically, Biological Market Theory (BMT) is used as a framework for understanding variation in cleaning mutualisms based on economic principles from human marketplaces. In both mutualisms and marketplaces, individuals exchange goods or services (in an economic marketplace, goods are exchanged for cash; in a mutualistic marketplace, parasite removal services are exchanged for food), and interactions can be positive, neutral, or negative for either party depending on supply and demand, and the costs and benefits of cooperating. This project combines field and lab experiments, behavioral observations, and mathematical modeling to explore several factors related to supply, demand, and the costs and benefits of interacting, and how they affect the decisions of cleaners and clients to interact cooperatively with one another. This project will provide research experiences to a postdoctoral researcher, scientific dive certifications and fieldwork experience to two undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds in marine science, and outreach to the public through community events and a podcast series. <br/><br/>This project enhances our understanding of context-dependency in mutualism by focusing on how three aspects of the context in which a cleaning interaction occurs—the “intragroup context,” the composition of the cleaner group, the “interspecific context,” the presence or behaviors of third-party species not directly involved in the mutualism, and the “spatial context,” the density and distribution of cleaning stations—link to extensive observed variation in interaction outcome, cleaning service quality, and decisions by cleaners and clients. Specifically, BMT predicts that (1) service quality should vary depending on contextual factors that affect supply and demand, and (2) individuals in mutualisms should assess potential partners and choose to interact only with those that provide the highest service quality. This work will combine non-invasive camera-based observations and experimental manipulations in nature with behavioral experiments in the lab and a spatially-explicit mathematical model of cleaning station distribution. Understanding how does the broader biotic (e.g., group or interspecific) or abiotic (e.g. spatial) context affect these crucial interactions, and what ecological and behavioral factors correlate with variation in mutualistic interaction outcome is important, since variation in the outcome of species interactions affects both the ecology of communities (e.g., variation in population growth and stability), and the evolution of species (e.g., the strength of selection on certain traits). Answers to these questions are currently lacking, especially in nature, but promise to significantly deepen our understanding of how mutualisms evolve, persist, and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
38,Studies in Moduli Theory and Birational Geometry,"The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry has significant applications in in coding, industrial control, computation, and in theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe. One focus of this project is moduli theory, which studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety, called a moduli space, in its own right. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. A second focus in this project is birational geometry, focusing here on resolution of singularities. Resolution of singularities is a fundamental procedure where ""bad"" points of an algebraic variety are removed and replaced by ""good"" points; it is the most powerful tool in the hands of a binational geometer. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>In more detail, regarding moduli spaces the PI will study the enumerative geometry of certain moduli spaces of surfaces, a decades-old challenge. In an area where birational geometry and moduli spaces overlap, the PI will continue to study the birational geometry of stack theoretic weighted blowups, a transformation that occurs frequently on moduli spaces that has proven instrumental in describing their geometry. Regarding resolutions of singularities, new algorithms will be developed for logarithmic resolution that are remarkably simpler than earlier ones, an algorithm for resolution in the presence of a nested family of foliations will be developed, and singularity invariants in positive characteristic will be studied that will lead to new insights into the formidable challenges of resolution in positive characteristic. These efforts will serve as platforms to directly mentor PhD students and young researchers, and for lectures and training programs reaching broader audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
39,Reconstructing global ice volume and bottom water temperature in the 41-kyr world - a novel integrated data and machine-learning approach,"Approximately 3 million years ago, Earth transitioned into an icehouse climate characterized by extensive continental ice sheets in both hemispheres. A notable aspect is the pronounced 41-thousand-year oscillations between relatively warm and cold climates, influenced by variations in Earth’s orbital tilt. It remains a mystery how these small changes in Earth’s orbital geometry can have such big impacts on the global climate. This study aims to tackle this puzzle by reconstructing global mean ocean temperature and ice volume from approximately 1 to 3 million years ago. The project will analyze multiple climate proxies, including organic biomarkers of marine phytoplankton and stable isotopes of calcareous planktonic foraminifera recovered from the Integrated Ocean Discovery Program. Machine-learning algorithms will be developed to resolve global ice volume and ocean temperature signals hidden within these climate proxies. The expected results can help assess the role of CO2 and ice albedo in global temperatures, evaluate the relationships between ocean cooling and ice-sheet expansion, and provide better insights into the long-term response of present ice sheets as temperatures rise. This project will foster interdisciplinary interactions among early career scientists, graduate and undergraduate students from both Earth Sciences and Applied Math, providing STEM students with an environment where mathematics, biogeochemical, and climatic understanding of the Earth system are well integrated in both classes and primary research.<br/><br/>A key switch in the mode of ice volume (IV) variabilities ~1 myrs ago (the Mid-Pleistocene Transition, MPT) shifted the major IV cycles from quasi-symmetric 41-kyr to asymmetric 100-kyr oscillations with no change in external forcing. Hypothesis tests that have assessed the Pleistocene evolution of ice-sheet dynamics and climatic feedback have generally assumed that global benthic foraminifera δ18Ob primarily reflects changes in global IV even though δ18Ob is known to be a mixture of both IV and bottom water temperature (BWT). This project will address a fundamental question regarding the MPT — how much δ18Ob variabilities before the MPT (“41-kyr world”) are attributable to IV as opposed to BWT? A new proxy-based Early-Pleistocene IV estimate will be developed with the aid of a novel statistical approach. Specifically, the project will (1) generate a set of high-resolution Early-Pleistocene UK’37-based Sea Surface Temperature (SST) paired with δ18O of planktonic foraminifera (δ18Op) from multiple marine sites (Integrated Ocean Discovery Program). Combining SST and δ18Op will allow changes in δ18O of seawater (δ18Osw) to be calculated as a proxy of global IV; (2) design a machine-learning framework for statistically robust estimation of IV (δ18Osw), which implements a multi-fidelity Gaussian process model and space state modeling with Kalman filter, to tackle the complexity of multi-core, multi-proxies time series in calculating IV and BWT and associated uncertainties. This approach differs from previous studies in that it requires no knowledge of sea level changes, no knowledge of δ18Ob in deriving δ18Osw, and makes no implicit assumption of the relationship between δ18Osw, BWT, and δ18Ob.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
40,Collaborative Research: Research Infrastructure: HNDS-I: Building AI-Based Tools for Continental-Scale Archaeological Surveys,"The archaeological record of human history is vast, spanning most of the planet's land masses, and mostly unrecorded, with knowledge derived from a tiny fraction of sites around the world. The lack of data from larger connected regions makes it difficult to understand how fieldwork-derived data from small sites fit within the bigger picture of the human past. This project pursues this big picture through a combination of fieldwork and artificial intelligence to produce an archaeological survey that uses high resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery. The datasets produced by this survey enable research on past human adaptation and social networks on a continental scale. <br/><br/>Mapping how human populations and settlements are distributed within geographic regions is a critical step for understanding how societies change and adapt to their surroundings. Archaeology is often the only source of information about human settlement patterns before the Early Modern era, but it is extremely challenging to use the field’s traditional methods to map sites across regions. This project meets that challenge by developing artificial intelligence models to identify archaeological features in high resolution satellite imagery, over an area of nearly two million square kilometers. The project develops new deep learning models that are tuned for feature detection and deployed to identify abandoned structures across vast areas. These models are important for research in diverse fields such as earth and environmental sciences, infrastructure planning, and emergency response. The models' results are combined and audited with observational data from fieldwork in different regions. The models and data are open-source and available to the research community to study long-term trends in human adaptation, settlement, and demography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
41,Statistical Policy Choice in Dynamic Environments,"This award will fund research to develop new methods to guide economic and other public policy making in rapidly changing environments. Policy makers, such as Central bankers, fiscal authorities, and foreign currency dealers, make decisions in rapidly changing environments in which they often have to learn and adapt on-the-fly. However, economists do not currently have methods that can effectively guide policy makers in these changing environments. This research will build on methods in statistical decision theory, frameworks for establishing causation from data, and research in machine learning to develop new methods to inform evidence-based policy choices while accounting for uncertainty about the environment. The results of this project will make important contributions to economic science by offering new methods to guide policymakers. The results will improve the quality of policy making, increase efficiency, productivity, and economic growth hence improve the living standards of citizens. <br/><br/>There are many challenges inherent in studying optimal policy choices in dynamic environments, including nonstationary dynamic causal effects, non-iid observations, ensuring external validity, and agents' reactions to changes in policy rules. This award funds research that builds on recent development in time-series, statistical decision theory, and machine learning to develop new econometric methods for policy analyses in dynamic environments. The first part studies short-run policy choice problems where reactions to policy choices by agents and long-run equilibrium spillovers are ruled out. The second part focuses on learning in a long-run policy rule considering agents’ reactions to changes in policy (i.e. robust to Lucas critique). The third part considers an unsupervised learning setting where the policymaker interacts with agents and the environment over time to collect data, learn about parameters governing the causal structure and data generating process, and chooses policy to maximize welfare. The results establish foundations for statistical decision theory and policy learning in dynamic settings and provide new methods to guide policy making in a wide range of empirical contexts. The results of this research will improve policy making, increase efficiency, productivity, and economic growth hence improve the living standards of citizens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
42,How Individual Bias Supports Collective Performance,"The national interest depends on high-quality decision-making in both the public and private sector. Most important decisions are the result of group deliberation. Therefore, a theory of effective discourse is proposed called adversarial cooperation. The proposed process divides the cognitive labor of a group into two distinct phases: conjecture and refutation. During the conjecture phase, the group leverages its members’ unique knowledge and skills to generate hypothesized solutions to a problem. In the refutation phase, the group stress-tests each solution, with group members acting as either supporters of their own proposed solution or as antagonists of other solutions. The group achieves consensus for the best decision on the assumption that reasoners are better at evaluating hypotheses that they disagree with than their own. So as long as the conjecture phase generates enough distinct potential solutions, the refutation phase is likely to converge on the best solution.<br/><br/>The proposed research program has four strands of behavioral experiments. In all cases, small groups of partisans are asked to collectively reason about politicized problems. The prediction is that the groups whose members are more adversarial (e.g. from two competing political parties) that decide by deliberation will outperform 1) more ideologically heterogeneous groups that deliberate and 2) groups that decide via some other collective action mechanism, such as judgment aggregation. The first experimental strand examines reasoning that requires creative idea generation (i.e. conjecturing). The second and the third strands examine cases that require rigorous stress-testing of existing ideas (i.e. refutations). The second strand focuses on evidence-based refutations and the third strand on argument-based refutations. The final strand applies the proposal to the detection of deepfakes. Are small groups of political adversaries working together more likely to detect the telltale signs of deepfake videos than small groups of co-partisans and state-of-the-art automated detection software?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
43,Arctic Atmosphere-ice Variability and Marine Accessibility: A Data-driven Approach,"Navigating the Arctic Ocean presents daunting challenges due to its darkness, remoteness, and harsh conditions, but has nevertheless prompted human incursions spanning millennia. The ability to traverse the Arctic Ocean has become of increasing importance over time, supporting people living in the Arctic and the strategic development of commercial opportunities. Navigability – the capacity to support safe passage for vessels – is critical for all Arctic operations, from global shipping to local fisheries, from resource extraction to military deployment, from tourism to traditional lifeways. Key to the assessment of this maritime access is understanding and predicting the frequency and intensity of extreme weather in the Arctic. This project will use computational approaches to develop future scenarios for the conditions that lead to shipboard ice accretion and dangerous sea ice convergence. The results will have far-reaching impacts including assessing the utility of these scenarios for Arctic operational planning on decadal time horizons, developing approaches to emerging high resolution climate information that can be generalized to other applications, and training of early career scientists in these challenging computational techniques.<br/><br/>To address the research goals, first, numerical weather prediction at daily resolutions will be used to develop a model of the probability along maritime shipping routes of (i) icing conditions leading to adverse operational impacts and (ii) sea ice convergence leading to dangerous ridging conditions. Second, the project team will develop and deploy machine learning techniques to enhance the spatial resolution of sea ice projections in geographically constrained segments of maritime routes, such as the heavily trafficked Arctic straits and emerging Canadian Archipelago routes. Third, these perspectives will be incorporated into future multi-model climate projections to develop more accurate scenarios of marine accessibility with regard to climate futures, jurisdictions, and routes. These generalizable insights will be developed on the use of machine learning to enhance the spatial resolution of climate model output variables for a range of applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
44,Partial Differential Equation Methods in Kinetic Theory and Their Applications,"The Principal Investigator (PI) will study several important mathematical problems arising in physics: 1) In the study of a body of gas with prescribed boundary temperature, the PI plans to understand mathematically the intriguing `ghost effect' on heat conduction predicted 50 years ago; 2) The control of plasma-wall interaction is important in nuclear fusion, and the PI will study the role of such interactions mathematically in a tokamak-like geometry. He also plans to derive and justify important fluid models for describing a plasma and to demonstrate absence of shock formation in the presence of an external magnetic effect; 3) In contrast to a black hole, a naked singularity is a gravitational collapse of a star which can be observed. The existence and stability of such a naked singularity is a fundamental theoretical open question in the study of Einstein's theory for general relativity. The PI plans to establish stability of a naked singularity recently discovered via his previous NSF support; 4) Even though contact lines (e.g. boundary line where coffee meets the coffee cup, or boundary line of a drop of fluid on a table) play an important role in the study of fluids, it has been an outstanding question to model and determine the dynamics of these contact lines. The PI continues his effort to understand this challenging problem mathematically. As broader impacts of the proposed research, the PI plans to work to investigate the ghost effect from experimental and numerical standpoints, in collaborations with other researchers. The PI also continues to train PhD students and postdoctoral fellows through these research projects.<br/><br/>On the technical level, the PI will 1) establish dynamical stability for recently constructed kinetic ghost effect in heat conduction, based on his recent decisive construction of `ghost effect' solutions; 2) Based on his recent work, the PI plans to construct global unique solutions for the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system, a fundamental kinetic model for describing a plasma, in the presence of a perfect conducting boundary in a tokamak-like geometry. The PI also plans to construct global well-posedness for Boltzmann equation with inverse power kernels in a bounded domain and derive fluid equations as the hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann theory; 3) The PI discovered that there is no shock formation in plasma two-fluid models (Euler-Maxwell system) for irrotational flows with small amplitude in his previously funded research. Thanks to his recent decisive discovery of a new mechanism of rotation to suppress singularity formation, the PI plans to construct global axisymmetric smooth rotating flows in the presence of an external magnetic field; 4) The PI continues his study to establish stability of gravitational collapse and naked singularity via analyzing spectrum problems in self-similar variables with the help of the interval arithmetic techniques; 5) The PI plans to establish the first PDE justification of dynamic fluid models for describing capillary surface or contact lines in 3D, based on his recent success in 2D.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
45,Thermodynamics of Water Phase Change in Isolated Single Digit Nanopores,"With support from the Chemical Structure and Dynamics (CSD) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Matthias Kuehne of Brown University is investigating the thermodynamics of water phase change under extreme nanoconfinement in pores with diameters on the order of 1 nm. The behavior of water in such nanometer-sized cavities is known to deviate strongly from bulk properties, yet prior studies of confined water have reported widely divergent phase transition temperatures for a given pore size. Professor Kuehne and his students will use a unique combination of photoluminescence spectroscopy, Raman excitation spectroscopy, electromechanical resonance measurements, and transient electrothermal methods to address this knowledge gap. Their studies will advance the fundamental understanding of the phase behavior, mass density, and heat capacity of water in well-defined cylindrical nanopores relevant to green energy technology and water desalination. The project outcomes are expected to ultimately benefit society by informing the engineering of advanced separation membranes and electrochemical devices, and by training the next generation of scientists and engineers in this important area of research. As part of the project's broader impacts, two educational videos will also be produced to engage the general public on topics related to fluids at the nanoscale.<br/><br/>Professor Kuehne's research examines three key aspects of water thermodynamics under cylindrical nanoconfinement between 4-500 K. First, photoluminescence and Raman excitation spectroscopy will be used to precisely determine water phase transition temperatures in isolated carbon nanotubes based on changes in the nanotube's optical and vibrational properties. Second, the total and interfacial mass densities of the confined water will be measured by combining electromechanical resonance techniques with Raman spectroscopy. Third, a transient electrothermal method will be coupled with Raman spectroscopy to determine the volumetric heat capacity. The research leverages the Kuehne lab's expertise in fabricating carbon nanotube nanofluidic devices and combines advanced optical and electrical measurement techniques in an innovative approach. Together, these complementary techniques will enable more reliable mapping of the phase diagram of water in single-digit nanopores and extracting enthalpies of phase change. The results will aid in resolving contradictions in reported phase transition temperatures for a given pore size and in developing accurate molecular models of nanoconfined water. The experimental tools developed in this project will further pave the way for systematic investigations of other confined fluids and electrolytes beyond water in future work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
46,Problems in Regularity Theory of Partial Differential Equations,"This project focuses on understanding certain types of partial differential equations (PDE) commonly encountered in physics and engineering, such as those governing elasticity and conductivity. When we study how materials deform under stress or conduct electricity, we often use equations to describe these phenomena. However, some equations don't behave smoothly, especially when dealing with high contrast materials or complex shapes. These situations can lead to equations that are much harder to analyze, and traditional methods may not work. Another area of study is equations from fluid dynamics. Understanding these questions is crucial for practical applications like designing airplanes or predicting weather patterns, and it also inspires new ideas in mathematics and statistics. Finally, the Principal Investigator (PI) is interested in kinetic equations, which describe how particles move and interact in systems like nuclear fusion experiments. By studying these equations, scientists hope to improve our understanding of how plasmas behave in extreme conditions, such as inside a tokamak. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/> <br/>As part of this project, the PI will carry out research closely related to the aforementioned topics and will attempt to address some of the open problems in these areas. The focus will be on several projects that can be gathered into three main topical areas. First, the project will develop new methods to study elliptic equations arising in composite materials (e.g., elasticity problems, conductivity problems). The PI is particularly interested in the blowup behaviors of solutions to PDE in domains with Lipschitz inclusions, equations involving the p-Laplacian, and the insulated problem for the Lamé system. Second, the project will explore the free boundary problem involving an incompressible fluid permeating a porous medium, often referred to as the one-phase Muskat problem. The focus will be on investigating the regularity of solutions to the two- and three-dimensional one-phase Muskat problem in the whole space, as well as on exploring the short-term and long-term smoothing effects of these solutions. Finally, the project will investigate boundary regularity of linear kinetic equations as well as the stability and global well-posedness of nonlinear kinetic equations, including the relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau system and the spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations in general domains.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Analysis Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
47,NSF-BSF: Mechanisms of Perceptual Enhancement by Action Preparation,"A major goal of perception is to enable an organism to perform actions that ensure its survival. Early theories assumed this process was simple and unidirectional: We perceive things in our environment, process it with high-level cognition, and then plan and execute appropriate actions. In contrast to this view, recent studies suggest that our actions can also influence how we perceive things. For example, people are better at perceiving the changes in the orientation of objects when they are intending to grasp them. This project aims to determine the mechanisms underlying this perception-action interdependence, using a combination of behavioral, psychophysical, physiological, and computational approaches. The work involves the collaboration of two international research teams, one based in the United States and one in Israel. The investigators are also committed to promoting inclusivity and diversity by mentoring talented undergraduates in an EPSCoR state, as well as nationally selected students from groups underrepresented in science. Additionally, the investigators will produce and distribute multimedia science cartoons (SciToons) aimed at K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.<br/><br/>The questions addressed here focus on the mutual interdependence of perception, cognition, and action. The project integrates novel empirical methods with continuous action tracking, pupillometry, and computational modeling. The first goal is to understand how determinate actions need to be in order to influence visual perception. The second goal is to assess which aspects of visual processing improve when we prepare to act or have been trained to act. The third goal is to determine whether preparing to act enhances visual processing by changing how much attention is paid to the target and/or how quickly it grabs attention. The aim is to advance our understanding of the interdependence between perception and action-driven mechanisms. The work has the potential to advance technological innovations in the areas of human factors, human-robot interaction (HRI), and artificial intelligence by identifying and exploiting the interactions among cognitive, perceptual, and motor functions.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Perception, Action, and Cognition and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
48,Collaborative Research: Robophysical Modeling of Bacterial Swimming Motion,"The swimming motion of bacteria represents a complex phenomenon that intersects the fields of microbiology and fluid dynamics. The movement of bacteria is vital for colonization and infectious pathogenic process, enabling them to exploit resources in diverse locations and escape from unfavorable conditions. However, a complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying bacterial swimming remains elusive due to the intricate interplay of physical and biological factors. To overcome these challenges, the project will leverage the emerging field of robophysical modeling, employing techniques from robotics to realistically emulate biological systems and unravel the influences of various physical and biological factors. The outcomes will advance the mechanistic understanding of the motility behaviors of one of the most ubiquitous and important life forms on Earth. The project will also broaden research participation by undergraduate students through the use of senior design projects and enhance fluid dynamics education by creating education films based on the project outcomes. <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to advance the understanding of how fluid mechanical forces shape the ways bacteria navigate their complex environments and interact with each other. This project undertakes a convergence approach, fusing knowledge and techniques in fluid dynamics, microbiology, and robotics to achieve the goal. By adopting techniques of robophysical modeling, the project will isolate physical effects governing bacterial swimming from other uncontrollable, complex biological factors, enabling experimental studies of bacterial swimming with unprecedented flexibility and accuracy. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations will elucidate how different non-Newtonian rheological behaviors impact their locomotion, characterize bacterial swimming near surfaces, and examine the hydrodynamic interactions of neighboring swimming bacteria. The integration of theoretical modeling with direct experimental validations will critically assess existing and new hypotheses pertaining to the physical mechanisms responsible for experimentally observed swimming behaviors of bacteria in complex environments. The project outcomes will support the ultimate goal of transforming fundamental knowledge of bacterial motility into future biomedical and technological advancements. The education and training opportunities provided by the project will also educate future STEM workforce on disciplinary convergence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
49,Conference: STEM Diversity Drivers,"The Leadership Alliance at Brown University will convene a pilot Regional Conference on STEM Mentoring entitled the ""STEM Diversity Drivers Conference"" in the fall of 2024 at Johns Hopkins University. This will be a two-day regional conference that convenes roughly 100 in-person and 120 virtual undergraduate and graduate faculty as well as research professionals. Regional conference institutions participating include: Howard University, Johns Hopkins University, Morgan State University, University of Maryland-Baltimore County and University of Virginia. The specific aims of the conference are to: (1) increase awareness and discuss the barriers that underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines face in the STEM enterprise; (2) elucidate varied experiences that collectively contribute to increased identity, efficacy and persistence in the STEM workforce; and, (3) create a collaborative interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral community for near-peer mentorship models.

50,Collaborative Research: Legitimacy and Efficacy of Transitional Justice Institutions in Comparative Perspective,"This study will assess how the design of transitional justice institutions in countries affected by conflict and/or authoritarianism affects public opinion, thereby shaping long-run national outcomes including regime type and conflict recurrence. Existing literature on the effects of transitional justice is inconclusive; such work is divided between micro-level, single-country studies and macro-level, cross-country studies as well as between studies of post-authoritarian and post-conflict contexts. By collecting comparable survey measures across three countries that vary along several theoretically relevant dimensions and by building a cross-national dataset, this project will bridge these gaps. Further, the researchers will develop and test a novel theory about how public attitudes mediate the relationship between transitional justice institutions and long-run outcomes. Given the widespread use of transitional justice in post-conflict and post-authoritarian countries as well as democracies around the world, there is an urgent need for the field of transitional justice studies to develop a stronger base of evidence for policymaking. This project will shed light on which forms of transitional justice effectively promote peace, democracy, justice, and reconciliation as well as provide insights into how countries’ unique histories may shape the impact of transitional justice there.<br/><br/>This project will investigate three questions. First, which kinds of transitional justice do people see as more legitimate? Second, how do people’s perceptions of the legitimacy of transitional justice institutions affect their broader political attitudes concerning the government, principles of democracy and autocracy, and out-groups? Third, do transitional justice institutions perceived as more legitimate contribute to peace and democracy following conflict? To address these questions, the research team will draw on their extensive thematic, regional, and methodological expertise to employ a mixed-methods research design which combines survey experiments in Colombia, Iraq, and Ukraine; qualitative evidence collected from focus groups and elite interviews in the same countries; and original cross-national data. This approach will leverage the strengths of diverse methodologies by combining (A) micro-level survey and qualitative data that will enable the investigators to assess the effects of varying transitional justice processes on individual attitudes with (B) macro-level cross-national data that will provide insight into the effects of institutions and historical context on national-level outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
51,SHF: Small: Machine Learning-based Combinatorial Optimization for Electronic Design Automation and Beyond,"Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools enable the design, analysis, and manufacturing of chips at an unprecedented scale. However, these tools are limited by their reliance on heuristic-based optimization and expert knowledge, which can slow down the chip design process, sometimes taking months or even years. To address this inefficiency, this project introduces an initiative to enhance design productivity by integrating Machine Learning (ML) techniques into EDA optimization algorithms. This integration aims to improve both the performance and speed of these algorithms, potentially revolutionizing the way chip designs are completed. The broader impacts of this project include extensive educational outreach and industry transfer efforts in line with the CHIPS and Science Act, aiming to enhance semiconductor research and workforce training in an Estab­lished Program to Stim­u­late Com­pet­i­tive Research (EPSCoR) state.<br/><br/>The proposed ML-EDA co-optimization framework seeks to standardize the application of ML in core EDA combinatorial optimizations across various scenarios. By developing numerical embeddings of chip design instances at every stage of the EDA process, these embeddings are utilized as input features for ML-based optimizations. This setup allows for optimizations that are tailored to specific design instances, leveraging three innovative ML engines: deep metric learning for optimal hyperparameter selection, reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making in EDA tools, and a back-propagation approach that restructures combinatorial EDA problems into graph-based computing models for faster, more effective solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
52,Assessing the roles of wear and roughness on dynamic fault friction,"Faults that host earthquakes are naturally rough. Rough patches on fault surfaces can collide and lock, preventing any further movement on a fault. Earthquakes begin when these rough patches break, and earthquake characteristics are controlled by frictional processes at the fault surface that evolve as the earthquake occurs. This project will advance our understanding of the physics of earthquakes by exploring two mechanisms that may regulate the friction of faults during earthquakes. The first occurs when heating leads to increased pressure in fluids, which can promote continued slip in earthquakes through lubrication, and the second is hardening due to producing more space for the lubricating fluids, which can impede earthquakes. To better understand these processes, the PI will conduct experiments at earthquake like conditions using a one-of-a-kind deformation apparatus at Brown University. The PI will test the roles of natural fault roughness and wear processes on the two competing processes. The results from this work will advance our understanding of earthquake physics and will inform the development and modification of new and existing earthquake rupture models. These models play a vital role in mitigating earthquake hazard and risk worldwide by improving the understanding of earthquake processes. This project will also enable the PI’s continued participation in DEEPS CORES, a program that develops and implements STEM curriculum for local Providence public schools. DEEPS CORES aims to expand participation in STEM fields from under-represented groups and to improve science literacy of the general public.<br/><br/>Experimental validation of physics-based constitutive equations that describe the frictional behavior of geologic materials during seismic slip is a critical step in advancing physics-based dynamic rupture models for earthquakes. This work will use the newly modified Tullis Rotary Shear Apparatus at Brown University to conduct several suites of dynamic rock friction experiments investigating two mechanisms that may regulate the frictional behavior of faults during earthquakes: thermal pore-fluid pressurization weakening (TPW) and dilatancy hardening (DH). TPW occurs as frictionally heated pore fluids thermally expand faster than the fault pores. In poorly drained conditions during seismic slip, this leads to increases in the pore pressure that decrease the shear stress acting on the fault thereby weakening the fault. DH has the opposite effect in which shearing causes the formation of new microcracks increases total pore volume, thereby reducing pore fluid pressure and strengthening faults. TPW will only be significant during earthquakes if DH is minimal. To elucidate to roles of wear and fault roughness on dynamic friction and explore the balance between TPW and DH, the PI is conducting experiments at slip rates up to 1 m/s, elevated confining pressures (45-60 MPa), and elevated pore pressures (25-40 MPa) on samples with both variable permeability and sliding surface roughness mimicking the range of fault roughness measured on faults in nature. Mechanical data will be combined with microstructural analysis and micromechanical modelling to guide the analysis and interpretation of results. These experiments will be the first with independently controlled and elevated pore pressure, confining pressure, and normal stress at slip rates of 1 m/s. It will establish conditions under which wear processes, enhanced by natural fault roughness, allow TPW to develop in samples with varying permeabilities and will also establish the extent to which DH counteracts TPW on rough surfaces at high displacements.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Earth Sciences, Geophysics Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
53,Conference: 27th International Congress on Plant Reproduction,"This award from the National Science Foundation will be used to enable early career scientists to attend the 27th International Congress on Plant Reproduction. This is an important professional development opportunity that will help to build research capacity and expertise in an area that is critical for crop productivity. The 27th International Congress on Plant Reproduction will be held in Providence, RI from July 7-10, 2024. This is the premier international conference dedicated to reporting advances in our understanding of how plant reproduction works at the cellular and molecular level. This field is particularly important for advancing crop productivity because reproduction is central to production of crops like corn, wheat, and rice. In addition, research in this field has led to advances in breeding technology, which benefit all crops. The conference will be highly interactive and will facilitate formal scientific discussion via oral presentations to the entire group and poster presentations to smaller groups. <br/><br/>The conference will attract ~200 scientists from around the world, with most participants coming from North America, Europe, and Asia. The conference will feature an eminent group of speakers representing multiple nations and multiple career stages and expertise. They will present their findings in major areas of research in molecular plant reproduction, ensuring a comprehensive and insightful program. Plant reproduction is sensitive to temperature and other stresses and is directly required for production of key agricultural products like maize kernels, rice and wheat grains, and tomato fruits. As we face the challenge of feeding a growing population in a changing climate, we must build a diverse and inclusive research community that is dedicated to working in this critical field. Travel awards will be granted to researchers at United States institutions who would otherwise be less likely to attend, including participants from predominantly undergraduate and minority-serving institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
54,Collaborative Research: Large-Scale Wireless RF Networks of Microchip Sensors,"The world around us is increasingly surrounded by electronic sensors. For applications such as wearable and implantable biomedical sensors there is a particular need and opportunity for unobtrusive microdevices which operate autonomously as large ensembles to map physiological activity across a body area of interest. A challenge is how to construct a wireless network whereby data from a microsensor population is transmitted, received, and decoded to unravel data, say from 1000 individual sensors. A rough analogy is that of a population of common radio-frequency tags which must be read at once by a single transceiver - with the twist that signals at each sensor location will now vary both in time and in magnitude. A brain-computer interface suggests a paradigm in this context: how to capture neuronal signals at high resolution by a population of autonomous brain implanted microsensors. Ongoing research for development of brain-machine interfaces in laboratories worldwide is focused on a number of schemes where access to thousands of points in the cortex is sought to translate brain computations to useful electronic commands e.g. for intended speech. The neurotechnology problem is three-fold: to record electrical signals from the brain unobtrusively, to transmit the data wirelessly to a body external receiver, and to decipher the multitude of signals in real time. Many cases of distributed sensing of a dynamical environment are characterized by sparsity of events whether in nature or man-made systems, neurons in the brain being an example. The proposed event-driven communication strategy enables the efficient transmission, accurate retrieval, and interpretation of sparse events across a network of thousands of wireless microsensors – using the brain as an inspiration. <br/><br/>The proposed work is focused on an all-in-one approach to build a large scale wireless microsensor radio-frequency network. An external transceiver collects data while supplying wireless power to the sensors. Each sensor is a sub-millimeter size silicon system-on-microchip with custom circuitry designed for ‘event detection’ where time-varying sensor inputs are encoded as a series of short ‘spikes’. The brain-inspired method of encoding data from sparse events has emerged recently in so- called dynamic vision cameras. Spike train data are converted into digital form on chip and transmitted to one common receiver. Since only the event-driven spikes are transmitted through the network, the bandwidth of the communication system can be utilized very efficiently enabling a large population of sensors to be incorporated into the network.<br/>The team proposes to build a microsensor system and demonstrate low-error rate and efficient asynchronous, encoded wireless transmission in the laboratory using fabricated microchips, and to show extended applicability to thousands of nodes though simulations.<br/>Importantly, the event-sensing detection and wireless communication approach is quite suited for a neuromorphic computational approach for analyzing multisensory data; the third key element in the project. The team will show how to decode actual brain data (synthesized elsewhere from actual primate brain recordings) from a hypothetical implant composed of up to 8000 microsensors. Neuromorphic computing appears particularly suited decoding event-based data in terms of efficiency and short latency. Using available data from the primate motor cortex the team plans to show how to decode wireless signals from thousands of neurons for the prediction of planned arm and hand movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
55,Collaborative Research: Novel computational methods to examine students' concepts of biological variability,"Both children and adults often display essentialist biases—assuming that groups, such as biological species, are uniform in their features—which can lead them to underestimate variability within-species and across generations. This project will examine learners’ understandings of biological variability, a key foundational concept in biology education, that is linked to understanding genetics and inheritance. The researchers will investigate the connection between children’s essentialist biases and their reasoning about the extent and dimensions of biological variability within species. The researchers will conduct a longitudinal study with four to twelve year old children and with adults to chart a clearer picture of how ideas about trait variability develop. This research will provide new insights into children’s categorization of species and into changes in children’s understanding of biological variability that occur with age and experience. This could ultimately allow educators to develop science education interventions targeted to individuals that are designed to increase students' understanding of this core biological concept and to allow understanding of biological variability and genetic inheritance to be evaluated more precisely. This project is supported by the ECR program which supports fundamental research that generates foundational knowledge that advances the research literatures in STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This proposal will investigate the development of learners' beliefs about biological variability in terms of phenotypic traits and their inheritance. Current methods in educational research for assessing students’ understanding of variability are typically cognitively demanding and time-consuming and have only been able to capture a coarse picture of children’s notions of biological variability. This proposal will introduce a cutting-edge method of mathematical modelling called Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCp), an adaptive computer algorithm designed to assess and explore individuals' understanding of biological categories more accurately. MCMCp infers how representative or probable individual category members are in an individual’s category representation. It does this without having to specify all experimental stimuli a priori. Instead, the method explores children’s notions of representativeness adaptively– that is, it uses the learner’s previous responses in the task to inform which stimuli should be presented to the learner next. Using this approach will enable a more precise characterization of children’s and adults’ species concepts and the extent to which they accept variability in phenotypic expression within a species. The researchers will assess learner’s assumptions about within-species variability across a range of traits and organisms as well as their assumptions about genetic variability--variation between parents and offspring. They will also study non-animal categories (one natural kind, one artifact) to understand whether and how essentialist biases apply to non-biological kinds as well as biological kinds. This research will lay a foundation for designing effective, individualized early education curricula for central biological concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
56,EAGER: Space-Time-Pulsed Engineered-Excitation For Diffraction-Free Imaging,"Fluorescence imaging in live animals is transforming brain science. However, the light that travels through<br/>brain tissue undergoes unwanted scrambling or its trajectory as the tissue becomes thick, which ultimately<br/>alters the original direction of travel. Thus, it remains a challenge to obtain clear, high-resolution images of<br/>the brain for fluorescence imaging at depths beyond the thickness of human hair. This work will develop a<br/>new type of optical microscopy—space-time-pulsed engineered-excitation for diffraction-free imaging<br/>(SPEEDI)—that makes use of exotic space-time wave packets (STWPs), which have been found to resist<br/>scrambling by objects encountered along its travel path. Experiments pursued will incorporate various types<br/>of tissue specimens, and results will be compared to those obtained us other conventional types of<br/>microscopy techniques. The project will also provide a platform to recruit students from diverse<br/>backgrounds to learn about microscopy. Scientific concepts learned from the project will also be integrated<br/>into an existing optics course.<br/><br/>The proposed technology will allow imaging across all Neocortical layers using one-photon (1P) sources,<br/>which are significantly more affordable than multiphoton sources, broadly enhancing accessibility. SPEEDI<br/>would be able to provide 1P imaging at depth with cellular precision without surgical removal, and it would<br/>enable depth-resolved use of 1P-optimized indicators, including the next generation voltage indicators. As<br/>SPEEDI is based on utilizing a new type of optical field, all of the advantages afforded from using twophoton<br/>and three-photon sources would also apply, e.g., further enhancement of penetration depth and<br/>signal-to-background ratio. In addition, the novel level of control obtained by modifying the underlying<br/>spatiotemporal spectral structure of SPEEDI enables exquisite manipulation of the properties of the STWPs<br/>in space and time, providing diffraction-free and dispersion-free propagation (of any order in the time<br/>domain), tunable group velocity, and temporal focusing over short distances in any medium. This level of<br/>exquisite control of the spatiotemporal properties will permit the introduction of ultra-high group-velocity<br/>dispersion (GVD) into the space-time wave packets (STWP), which will broaden rapidly on a controllable<br/>length scale even in free space or a low-GVD medium. Therefore, by first introducing group-delay<br/>dispersion (GDD) into the initial generic pulse used to synthesize the STWP, the GVD enables the temporal<br/>focusing of the pulse at a prescribed depth. Indeed, the focusing depth can be tuned by either changing the<br/>initial GDD or modifying the GVD introduced into the STWP, both of which can be realized electronically<br/>with no moving parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
57,Reconstructions of central tropical Pacific climate during the 19th to early 20th centuries,"The tropical Pacific Ocean has a strong influence on global climate. This influence is evident during El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Interannual ENSO variations in the tropical Pacific drive large shifts in global weather patterns, including regional rainfall extremes that can lead to floods, droughts, and wildfires. Decade-to-decade changes in the tropical Pacific also have large impacts on global climate, including the rate and pattern of global warming. Thus, to predict future changes in global climate and weather extremes we must know about the long-term state of the tropical Pacific and about changes in ENSO variability. However, the impacts of human activities since the start of the Industrial Revolution on conditions in the tropical Pacific are poorly known. This limits our ability to predict climate for the coming decades. Direct climate observations from the central equatorial Pacific are sparse prior to 1950, but this data gap can be filled by records of climate from geologic archives such as corals, tree rings, and ice cores. This project will use precisely dated coral records from the central equatorial Pacific to produce a record of ocean temperature since about 1800. This temperature record will be compared with climate model simulations to understand the observed trends and variability in ocean temperature, and their impact on climate. The project will support research by both graduate and undergraduate students. It will also develop outreach videos aimed at K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/><br/>The project aims to generate up to 20 new precisely-dated records of monthly-resolved sea-surface temperature and hydrological variability in the central tropical Pacific during the period from 1800-1950CE using paired oxygen isotope and trace element measurements in modern and fossil corals from Kiritimati Island (2N, 157W). The proposed work builds on the success of recent ""ensemble"" approaches to coral-based climate reconstruction that allow for the development of high-fidelity, monthly-resolved records tropical Pacific climate with explicit quantification of uncertainties, grounded in calibration of modern corals against instrumental climate records over recent decades. Moreover, the application of paired coral d18O and Sr/Ca analyses allows for the separate identification of temperature and hydrological trends over the last centuries - filling critical data gaps and allowing for detailed data-model intercomparison with advanced ocean state reanalyses products. The proposed work includes the application of a wide variety of strategies to assess the robustness of the coral-based climate records, including detailed analysis of sample preservation, as geochemical alteration can introduce significant artifacts into coral-based climate reconstructions if it goes undetected. If successful, the proposed work would provide a blueprint for the extension of the short instrumental climate record throughout the Pacific Ocean, utilizing samples from extensive coral rubble fields that are present on many ocean islands.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
58,Probing the Electronic Structure and Chemical Bonding of Cryogenically-Cooled Boron and Metal-Boride Nanoclusters,"With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Lai-Sheng Wang and his research group at Brown University will investigate size-selected boron and metal-boride nanoclusters using high-resolution photoelectron imaging and photoelectron spectroscopy. Boron has only three valence electrons compared to four in carbon and is thus considered to be electron deficient. The electron deficiency of boron results in complicated structures and unique chemical bonds in boron-containing molecules, which are challenging to investigate. Professor Wang and his students will generate boron and metal-boride nanoclusters using a home-built laser-vaporization cluster source and utilize photoelectron spectroscopy and imaging in conjunction with theoretical calculations to provide insights into their stabilities, structures, and chemical bonding. Their studies could lead to the discovery of novel boron- and boride-based nanostructures, as well as provide fundamental knowledge about boron chemistry and chemical bonding. The research in this project will be integrated into the teaching of physical chemistry, and will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in the design and construction of advanced experimental instrumentation and computational chemistry. <br/><br/>This project focuses on the structure and bonding of boron clusters to provide insight into the nature of the metal-boron bonds and structural evolution of large boron clusters to lay the foundation for new boron-based nanomaterials. To achieve these research goals, Professor Lai-Sheng Wang and his students have built two different types of apparatus for photoelectron spectroscopy. One apparatus involves a magnetic-bottle photoelectron analyzer and is aimed at providing photoelectron spectra with a wide range of photon energies. Well-resolved photoelectron spectra provide electronic fingerprints, which are crucial for comparison with theoretical calculations to elucidate the structures and bonding of size-selected boron nanoclusters. The second apparatus involves high-resolution photoelectron imaging, which is aimed at obtaining vibrational information. A cryogenically cooled ion trap is being developed to create cold boron clusters from the laser-vaporization source; this is needed to obtain vibrationally resolved photoelectron spectra for boron and metal-boride clusters. The broader impact of this project includes the discovery of novel boron-based nanomaterials with potential as new platforms for nanotechnology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
59,CRCNS US-German Collaborative Research Proposal: Neural and computational mechanisms of flexible goal-directed decision making,"To behave adaptively, people need to flexibly align their decisions with their immediate and long-term goals. Failures of such goal-directed decision-making can result in an array of maladaptive behaviors, such as financial risk taking, drug abuse, or gambling. While past research has helped identify the drivers of goal-directed decisions, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of how people are able to reorient those decisions as flexibly as they do, as well as when and why they fail to do so. In a series of studies that combine computational modeling with measures of behavior, attentional focus, and brain activity, we are studying the capacities and limits of human decision-makers to flexibly adjust their information search and actions to different goals and task demands. By uncovering the hidden levers and potential failure modes of goal-directed behavior, our work better disentangles sources of real-world decision-making failures, and provide a path towards targeted interventions to better align choices with long-term goals. <br/><br/>Our project addresses critical gaps in research on the neural and computational mechanisms that link decision-making and cognitive control. Past work on the computational and neural mechanisms of goal-directed decision-making has been singularly focused on a narrow subset of human goals (how people select the best option from a set). It is therefore unknown how people flexibly reconfigure to their wider array of goals – for instance, selecting under different criteria or accumulating information across options rather than comparing between them – and when and why they fail to do so. Our project develops and tests a computational framework that accommodates the range of flexibility observed in human decision-making, by representing explicit choice goals that define a) how information is translated into evidence and b) how evidence is then integrated to select responses. We are testing our framework in a series of studies that combine behavioral tasks with eye-tracking, EEG and fMRI. This multi-modal approach allows us to uncover the neural circuits and dynamics that enable people to flexibly transform and integrate information about their options to achieve their current goals, and to understand how and why people vary in these capacities. The project further supports outreach activities aimed at training researchers in computational methods for predicting and testing a wide array of decision-making behavior.<br/><br/>A companion project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
60,CAREER: Inertio-Capillary Dynamics of Particles at Interfaces,"This award supports integrated experimental and theoretical research on the motion of solid particles at a fluid interface. At sufficiently small scales, the effects of surface tension on particle motion can become important, for instance in allowing a paper clip to float on the surface of water despite being denser. While such static scenarios are well characterized generally, analogous dynamic scenarios arise throughout industry and nature (such as an airborne pollutant particle impacting a rain drop) and are far less studied. Insight into such particle dynamics at interfaces is critical to advancements in a range of technological applications, including pollution control, rapid manufacturing, biotechnology, and biomimetic and interfacial robotics. The planned research will be closely integrated with education and outreach activities including introducing undergraduate research experiences into the engineering curriculum and hands-on workshops in partnership with local camps and public libraries. <br/><br/>This award supports a broad effort to expand the knowledge of particles at fluid interfaces in the intermediate inertio-capillary regime, situated between the more well studied static equilibrium capillary regime and the large-scale inertially dominated regime. The targeted problems of focus include particle impact, interface-bound particle dynamics, and self-propulsion and collective motion of driven interfacial particles. The research effort will combine novel state-of-the-art experiment with first-principle modeling techniques, and establish a coherent and consistent physical understanding for each of the specific research problems. In addition to the research findings, custom experimental designs and protocols, as well as pedagogical materials, developed as part of this work will be shared openly and thus translatable for use in other research, instruction, and demonstration contexts. The overall research efforts will be closely integrated with the development of an Engineering CURE (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience) course. In other fields, it has been shown that such courses allow students to develop comparable levels of tangible and intangible skills as to traditional mentored research experiences but be more inclusive and diverse. Furthermore, the research activities will directly translate to hands-on demonstrations and workshops that will be executed in partnership with local camps, libraries, and other organizations, with an emphasis on engaging underrepresented groups in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
61,RII Track-4:NSF: Synthesis of Oxide Ferroelectric Rashba Semiconductors for Low Power Computing,"Driven by demands in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data, nanoelectronics are slated to consume a significant portion of the world's primary energy by the end of the decade. While current semiconductor materials and technologies face challenges meeting these demands, magnetic materials, which use the electron’s spin rather than charge, are promising alternatives. Despite this promise, efficient conversion and manipulation of magnetic spin signals remains a challenge. The goal of this NSF EPSCoR RII Track-4 fellowship project is to experimentally synthesize and characterize a new class of materials that can efficiently control and manipulate electron spins using ferroelectric polarization, called ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors. The PI and a graduate student will utilize the state-of-the-art thin film synthesis facilities at Cornell University’s Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials (PARADIM) growth facility to deposit candidate materials and measure the properties of these systems. This collaboration will improve our fundamental understanding of intrinsic spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms and could lead to new functionalities in memory and computing. This fellowship program will establish a long-term collaboration between Cornell University and Brown University to train graduate students in advanced thin film growth techniques. Furthermore, we will create a bilingual outreach program enabling Providence high school students to explore the Brown nanofabrication clean room.<br/><br/>CMOS semiconductor technologies are rapidly facing challenges in scalability, energy consumption, and reduced latency. These challenges are driving a significant effort to develop alternatives to CMOS-based technologies to meet the demands of future computing technologies. Spintronics, which exploits both spin and charge degrees of freedom for memory and logic, is one promising avenue. However, interconverting between charge and spin signals remains inefficient, and a fundamental understanding of intrinsic spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms is lacking. The objective of this research collaboration is to develop an emergent class of single crystal, epitaxial oxide thin film heterostructures of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERSCs), which exploit both ferroelectricity and magnetism at room temperature to manipulate spin-to-charge interconversion (SCI) for low power spintronic computing paradigms. Cornell University’s state-of-the-art, NSF-funded PARADIM molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) and the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR), an NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), will be used for materials synthesis and characterization. In this project, the researcher aims to optimize the synthesis of candidate FERSC heterostructures, characterize their structural and ferroic properties, correlate ferroelectricity and Rashba splitting to spin transport properties. Finally, the project will establish a long-term collaboration between the collaborator and the PI, as well as their respective institutions. A sustained collaboration will be instituted via three main mechanisms: 1) PI involvement in the user committee of PARADIM; 2) PI lecture during the annual PARADIM summer school; and 3) a Cornell PARADIM and Brown University joint seminar series designed to bolster future collaboration and users from Brown to PARADIM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
62,Education DCL: EAGER: Teaching Privacy via Stakeholder Modeling,"Education about the social impacts of privacy and cybersecurity is critical to individual welfare and to creating technology that is in the public interest, but it is also challenging to make effective. Students often struggle to relate abstract concepts like the right to privacy, control over personal data, or freedom of speech, to the concrete technical choices they must make. This project realizes and evaluates a new pedagogical approach to teaching privacy and cybersecurity, focused around ""stakeholders"": people who are directly or indirectly affected by a technical system. The project's novelties are (1) the stakeholder approach, which combines teaching about abstract, high-level concepts with concrete applications, and (2) a preliminary investigation of the effectiveness of this approach. The project's broader significance and importance are that it creates an effective template for privacy and cybersecurity, produces open-source assignment materials, and impacts computer science education through new pedagogies and curricular recommendations.<br/><br/>The project develops a new, stakeholder-focused approach to teaching privacy and security. The stakeholder approach is a template for reasoning about privacy and cybersecurity concerns in the development of technical systems, with a focus on relating high-level, abstract concepts to concrete implementation choices via stakeholder needs. The stakeholder needs give students concrete but possibly conflicting requirements to support. Ideally, the stakeholder approach leads to (a) students making deeper and more substantive connections between abstract concepts related to privacy and cybersecurity (e.g., data autonomy and ownership, transparency, accountability) and concrete social impacts (e.g., identity theft, reputational damage); (b) students engaging more deeply with social impact concepts and how they relate to technical decisions they face; and (c) students perceiving cybersecurity as an area in which they can work towards fair and equitable computing systems. The research team is developing and deploying stakeholder-based assignments in five computer science courses at Brown University, spanning introductory, intermediate, and upper-level courses taken by undergraduates and cybersecurity master's students. The data collected from these assignments will help answer the central research question of whether the stakeholder approach results in meaningful improvement in students' ability to relate normative concepts to concrete problems and technical design decisions. This work will therefore contribute to academic computer science education, workforce development, and socially-responsible computing by proposing new pedagogies and curricular structures for effective teaching of privacy and cybersecurity and their societal context.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
63,RII Track-4:NSF: Evaluating the Role of Deep Ocean Equilibration in Warmer Climates,"This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows project will provide a fellowship to a Senior Research Associate and training for a graduate student at Brown University. This work would be conducted in collaboration with researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2021) predicts that atmospheric pCO2 will likely reach 940-1490 ppm by the end of the century. Consequently, global temperature is expected to increase by 1.5-4.5°C. This relationship between pCO2 levels and the magnitude of warming estimated from climate models is known as climate sensitivity. Models, however, are built upon an incomplete understanding of Earth’s climate system and, to some extent, upon simplifications of biogeochemical- and physical processes that drive climatic feedback due to our limited computational capability to fully grasp the vast complexity of the system. On the other hand, reconstructions of past climate change using deep-time archives, although sparse in time and space, offer ground truths of equilibrium climatic responses to elevated pCO2, allowing climatologists to benchmark the performance of climate models. In this proposed study, the PI and researchers at NCAR will collaborate to integrate paleoclimate reconstructions of 15 million years ago (aka. the Middle Miocene) with climate model simulations. Current studies suggest that the Middle Miocene was ~6-10°C warmer than today while estimated pCO2 was only 200-300 ppm higher. This suggests a climate sensitivity of 6-10°C warming per doubling of pCO2, much higher than the 1.5-4.5°C suggested by IPCC 2021. The new study aims to explore possible explanations for this model-data discrepancy, with the hope that insights we gain from studying climatic processes under past warm conditions can improve our knowledge about future climate changes.<br/><br/>Projections of future global warming depend critically on our knowledge of climate sensitivity, which is continually refined by emerging reconstructions of past warm climates. The mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO, ~17.5-13.9 Ma) is one such period that has recently inspired the development of paleoclimate simulations, aimed at improving our understanding of climatic dynamics when estimated pCO2 was higher than today. Paleoclimate records, however, pose several challenges to climate models, including high climate sensitivities and flat meridional temperature gradients, both of which are difficult to reproduce in models. This proposal puts forth a hypothesis that a possibly overlooked contributing factor to MMCO warming and model-data disagreement is the equilibrium responses of the deep ocean under elevated CO2 forcing. Unlike SST, Miocene deep-ocean temperature and circulation have not received much attention. Yet increasing evidence suggests that the equilibrium responses of the deep ocean differ from transient responses, and significantly affect the spatial and temporal patterns of surface warming. Evolving feedback with changing SST patterns and the degree of equilibration in turn influences equilibrium climate sensitivity. This proposed study seeks to address this gap by (1) performing long-running MMCO simulations (>6000 years) in collaboration with Jiang Zhu at NCAR (host institution) to produce equilibrium responses of the deep ocean; (2) comparing simulated MMCO oceans with paleo-proxies including benthic δ13C and Neodymium isotopes (ɛNd) to explore patterns of Miocene ocean circulation; and (3) examining whether modeled equilibrium responses of the deep ocean reduce model-data mismatches in deep-water temperatures as well as the spatial patterns of SST, with focuses on the warming anomalies in the North Atlantic and the flat meridional temperature gradients during the MMCO.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
64,Collaborative Research: Scalable Nanomanufacturing of Perovskite-Analogue Nanocrystals via Continuous Flow Reactors,"Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are an emerging class of materials for next-generation photonic devices. However, the toxicity of lead has prevented them from being fully adopted by renewable energy technologies. Substitution of lead ions with eco-friendly metal ions such as copper, is a promising strategy to alleviate the toxicity issues of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals. However, scalable manufacturing of lead-free metal halide perovskites, known as perovskite-analogues, remains a challenge. This grant supports a collaborative research project that generates new knowledge related to scalable nanomanufacturing of high-performing perovskite-analogue nanocrystals using reconfigurable and modular continuous flow reactors. The new advanced manufacturing process leverages the high-throughput data generation capability of continuous flow reactors integrated with in-situ spectral characterization probes to enable precision synthesis of perovskite-analogue nanocrystals using a machine learning-assisted experimentation strategy. Lead-free semiconductor nanocrystals are increasingly preferred in photonic devices such as smart windows and luminescent solar concentrators. Large-scale manufacturing of lead-free perovskite-analogue nanocrystals with minimum energy loss can significantly reduce the total energy consumption across the U.S. and thereby benefit the nation's prosperity, health, and security. This collaborative research integrates multiple fields, including advanced manufacturing, materials chemistry, flow reactor engineering, and data science. The convergent nature of this collaborative project facilities broadening participation of women and other underrepresented groups in research and helps train next-generation leaders in science and engineering. The project plans to use YouTube to broadly disseminate the generated nanomanufacturing knowledge.<br/><br/>Scalable manufacturing of perovskite-analogue nanocrystals is a time- and resource-intensive undertaking using conventional batch reactors. This challenge is mainly due to the fast formation kinetics of perovskite-analogue nanocrystals, resulting in process-dependent nanocrystal properties. This collaborative research project is to address the advanced manufacturing knowledge gaps in scalable production of perovskite-analogue nanocrystals. The research team plans to utilize reconfigurable and modular flow reactors to study high-temperature precision nanomanufacturing of copper-based perovskite-analogue nanocrystals using a decoupled precursor chemistry. Through integration of data science with automated flow reactors, the high-dimensional nanomanufacturing space of copper-based perovskite-analogue nanocrystals are rapidly explored to identify optimal nanomanufacturing routes of fabricating high-performance nanocrystals with desired optical and optoelectronic properties for device applications. The application of reconfigurable and modular continuous flow reactors with on-demand and selective precursor heating capability to nanomanufacturing is unique and a powerful way to enable precision manufacturing and increase production scale at which copper-based perovskite-analogue nanocrystals and other energy-relevant materials can be economically manufactured.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

67,RII Track-4:NSF: Resistively-Detected Electron Spin Resonance in Multilayer Graphene,"This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-4 EPSCoR Research Fellows project will provide a fellowship to an Assistant Professor and training for a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University. Spin is an intrinsic property of electrons, which is key to understanding electronic properties of quantum materials at low temperatures. For instance, magnetism occurs when spins of many electrons align in a preferred direction, whereas the nature of superconductivity is crucially dependent on the spin configuration of the underlying electron pairs. In atomically thin materials consisting of two to three layers of carbon atoms, the reduced dimension enhances Coulomb correlation (describes the correlation between the spatial position of electrons due to their Coulomb repulsion), which further amplifies the role of electronic spin. This project aims to develop an experimental method to directly probe the configuration of electron spins in these 2D materials. The proposed effort takes advantage of the state-of-the-art user facility at the National High Magnetic Field Lab. By exposing students and researchers to cutting-edge research in the national lab, the research and outreach program inspires and educates future scientists and engineers to take on leadership roles and pioneer innovations in the field of quantum science and quantum material research. The research project also aims to establish a user program located in Rhode Island, which promises to have wide wide-ranging impact on training Rhode Island’s quantum-deficient workforce by providing research and intern positions for different levels of students.<br/><br/>The low-temperature phase diagram of strongly correlated 2D materials hosts many exotic quantum phases, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism. To understand the microscopic origin underlying these emergent phenomena, it is key to first identify the exact configuration of electronic spin. However, the lack of viable experimental methods presents a hurdle to uncovering the order in the spin degrees of freedom, which gives rise to one of the main challenges for research efforts aiming to better understand the nature of electronic states in 2D materials such as multilayer graphene. In this proposal, the PI puts forth a new paradigm of experimental methods that are capable of directly probing the nature of electronic spin, which utilizes resistively detected electron spin resonance measurement. Moreover, The PI will investigate the Coulomb-driven process of spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. Recent experimental progress demonstrated that spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking can be characterized based on angle-resolved nonreciprocal transport measurement. Building on these developments, the proposed research project will investigate the electronic spin configuration in multilayer graphene, such as Bernal stacked bilayer graphene and magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, along with its connection to the process of spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. Results from this project will have a far-reaching impact by providing new insights into the nature of electronic orders stabilized by the interplay between strong correlation and nontrivial topology. The proposed project will utilize the state-of-the-art user facility at the National High Magnetic Field Lab (NHMFL), where capable staff scientists provide strong technical support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
68,Expediting Solutions to Hard Multi-Robot Path Finding Instances,"How can many independent robots completing tasks in a shared space move about safely without collisions? There are many scenarios where using many robots working together can improve efficiency, safety, and quality of life. For example, self-driving cars can move people quickly, safely, and efficiently, while reducing delays and vehicular accidents. Warehouse robots can pick and pack items without humans walking around a giant warehouse, which can lead to the human employees’ exhaustion and repetitive injuries. Autonomous drones delivering residential packages can reduce vehicular traffic on the road and provide reliable and extremely quick delivery. Coordinating many robots safely and efficiently in cluttered environments is fundamentally important in these and many other current and future real-world problems. As robots become an increasingly common element of our society, multi-robot coordination will grow exponentially in importance. In this project, we will try to deepen our understanding of the problem of collision-free path finding for many robots in a shared space. The problem of optimally coordinating many robots to maximize efficiency or speed while avoiding collisions is extremely computationally intensive. While there exist a large array of algorithms that can solve these problems, each of these algorithms excel in some instances but flop in others. Currently, experts in solving this problem have a general sense of which algorithms will handle certain instances of a planning problem, but having an expert in the loop is not feasible for large-scale deployment, for example, in self-driving cars or drone package delivery. In this project, we will take a data-driven approach to understanding under what conditions solvers excel, and under what conditions they stumble. The goal of this project is to find novel ways to break down large problems into smaller subproblems that can be more easily solved and understand the gaps that exist in the current array of solvers, so that future solvers can be developed to address those gaps. <br/><br/>The problem of finding collision-free paths for multiple agents from start vertices to assigned goal vertices in a graph, known as the labeled multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem, is NP-Hard. Labeled MAPF is well studied, with many optimal solvers available; however, they are not able to scale to the number of robots present in some modern multi-robot systems, such as autonomous warehouses. Rather than develop new MAPF solvers, this research will use existing machine learning techniques to leverage the strengths of existing labeled MAPF solvers, producing new techniques and algorithms that will allow scaling up for application to large robot swarms and will solve instances that existing solvers cannot yet solve. The approach is threefold. First, the team will exploit the strengths of MAPF solvers by using machine learning to train an algorithm selector to predict the fastest MAPF solver for a particular instance from a portfolio of solvers. Second, they will develop methods for effective decomposition of large MAPF instances into smaller sub-instances that can be solved in parallel using solvers selected by our algorithm selector, increasing speed and scale. Finally, they will develop methods for estimating the empirical hardness of a MAPF instance, i.e., how long each solver will take to solve an instance. Results will be evaluated using established metrics for MAPF solvers, measuring the number of new instances our algorithms solve, and progressively demonstrating them in simulations with hundreds of robots. This project will significantly improve the tractability of many-robot path finding and provide understanding of the hardness of the problem at scale. It will expand the limited understanding of what makes some MAPF instances challenging; develop novel algorithms and techniques to enhance existing and future MAPF algorithms; and significantly increasing the number of robots for which optimal non-colliding paths can be found. It will also produce the largest benchmarking of optimal MAPF solvers to date and help other MAPF researchers understand the strengths and weaknesses of existing MAPF solvers. The work is at the intersection of robotics and combinatorial optimization and will be instantly impactful to those communities. The results will significantly improve planning performance for many-robot systems, and thus will have far-reaching impacts in robotic warehousing, autonomous vehicles, autonomous delivery, just-in-time manufacturing, and many other fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
69,CISE-ANR: HCC: Small: Learning to Translate Freehand Design Drawings into Parametric CAD Programs,"Computer Aided Design (CAD) is a multi-billion dollar industry responsible for the digital design of almost all manufactured goods. It leverages parametric modeling, which allows dimensions of a design to be changed facilitating physically-based optimization and design re-mixing by non-experts. But CAD’s potential is diminished by the difficulty of creating parametric models: in addition to mastering design principles, professionals must learn complex CAD software interfaces. To promote effective modeling strategies and creative flow, design educators advocate freehand drawing as a preliminary step to parametric modeling. Unfortunately, CAD systems do not understand these drawings, so designers must re-create their entire design using complex CAD software. This research project explores the question, ""Is it possible to automatically convert freehand drawings to parametric CAD models?"" By leveraging the visual vocabulary shared by drawing and CAD modeling, this project will develop a system to translate from the natural language of drawing to the formal language of CAD. This technology will increase the productivity of professional CAD designers across multiple industries and make CAD modeling accessible to more people without extensive training in confusing software interfaces.<br/><br/>To handle drawings as input, the researchers will treat them as timestamped sequences of strokes, allowing them to cast the problem as one of machine translation from drawing stroke sequences to CAD program token sequences. Drawing strokes are grouped into coherent drawing operations that are correlated with CAD modeling strategies (e.g. first drawing construction lines and simple primitives shapes, then refining). The researchers propose to extract these drawing operations as an intermediate representation, which helps disambiguate between the (potentially infinitely) many programs which can represent a single shape. Performing this extraction and then producing CAD programs are complex search problems; the researchers will leverage novel deep neural networks to guide the search. They will gather a paired (drawing, CAD program) dataset from professional designers to help develop these networks. They will also develop learning algorithms that do not require such ground-truth paired data. Finally, they will develop metrics to assess CAD programs produced by the system, which will be used both to evaluate the system's efficacy and to guide the program search process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
70,"Neural Network Approximation of PDEs - Efficiency, Reliability and Quantifiable Accuracy","Machine learning and neural networks (NN) are impacting everyday our lives in a way that few, if any, other mathematical tool has ever done before. Machine learning is also attracting fevered interest in the scientific computing community where neural network techniques have been applied to all manner of applications in scientific computing including the numerical solution of differential equations (PDEs). However, the bar is set much higher when it comes to applying neural networks to scientific applications, where there is an expectation that numerical methods are capable of producing high accuracy approximations, supported by a solid theoretical foundation, give results that make sense, are reproducible, intelligible to the analyst, and (ideally) come with reliable numerical bounds on the accuracy. Numerical simulation is routinely used in science and engineering applications to form the basis for a critical decision for which certain minimal levels of confidence in the numerical results are required. Machine learning and neural network techniques will not be accepted until and unless methods are developed that address these minimal requirements. Current machine learning and neural network methods for scientific applications in general, and numerical solution of PDEs in particular, are not at this level. The project includes graduate student training on the fundamental research questions relating to the project and implementation of numerical algorithms that verify the theoretical analysis.<br/><br/>This project builds on foundations in machine learning and neural network approximation with the overall objective of developing effective computational tools supported by rigorous theory that provide the analyst with the confidence to apply neural network based techniques to scientific applications. A key feature of the current project is the importance attached to developing rigorous theoretical foundations for the approach including a priori results on the convergence and accuracy of the methods. In addition, the proposal aims to provide quantitative estimates for the accuracy and fidelity of the resulting approximations through the provision of computable a posteriori estimators for the error. The techniques developed in this project will be applicable to a broad class of PDEs arising across a wide range of disciplines. The tools that will be developed will find immediate application in these areas. An important feature of the project is the development of effective training algorithms for neural networks that will have impact beyond the numerical approximation of PDEs that are the focus of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
71,Collaborative Research: Evaluating The Exhumation History of the Aleutians with Zircon And Apatite Thermochronology,"Island arcs are chains of volcanic islands that form at subduction zone plate boundaries where one plate is being dragged beneath another, recycling old crust to the Earth’s mantle and creating new continental crust through volcanism. A central question surrounding these systems is whether processes that occur deeply in the subduction zone affect processes that are observed on the surface. This is especially debated for what drives surface uplift and related island arc exhumation and erosion. Uplift and exhumation of island arcs in other localities have been attributed to a variety of factors, from deep tectonic drivers to climate-surface interactions, with exhumation rates and erosion estimates that vary by orders of magnitude. In many locations, the arc exhumation history is difficult to study because it may be overprinted by later thermal or physical processes. The Aleutian Arc is unique in that it includes over 50 islands composed of both active and inactive volcanoes over 1,900 miles from Alaska to Russia, and has limited overprinting by secondary events. In addition, it has a volcanic history that spans 50 million years, so that the ancient magma chambers of past volcanoes are now exposed on the islands’ surfaces today. These plutonic rocks hold a record of past island uplift, exhumation, and erosion that can address key questions regarding: When were the Aleutians uplifted? When and how much has been eroded through time? Was uplift and subsequent erosion constant or cyclical? How does it vary geographically along the length of the arc? Specifically, the answers to these questions will shed light on the link between plate-scale processes and uplift; the timing and magnitude of erosion, contributing sediment and geochemical inputs to North Pacific; and the relationship between plutonic exhumation rates, geochemistry, and emplacement depth. The Aleutians have functioned as a natural laboratory to test fundamental principles regarding subduction zone evolution for more than four decades. This study will make a novel contribution to the existing extensive geochemical and geodynamic research. In terms of Broader Impacts, this award supports a new PI and engages underrepresented minority students and teachers, from the undergraduate through K-12 level. <br/><br/>In order to quantify when and by how much the Aleutians experienced surface uplift and erosion, plutonic samples from ~10 islands that span 870 miles of arc length will be analyzed for emplacement depth and subsequent uplift rates. This work will place the exhumation history of the Central Aleutians in the context of 1) driving forces involving regional tectonics and subduction zone processes; and 2) geochemical inputs to the N. Pacific via erosion of arc material. In order to answer these questions, previously sampled and well-characterized plutonic rocks from across the central Aleutians will be characterized by pluton crystallization age, emplacement depth, and 2 or more thermochronometers with different thermal sensitivities (e.g., apatite and/or zircon, (U-Th)/He and/or fission track). Thermochronology techniques, particularly the use of multiple chronometers with different temperature sensitivities within the same sample, can constrain exhumation rates and be used to estimate erosion rates over time. Coupling the thermochronological data with emplacement depth will help constrain the amount of material eroded over that time. The timing and geographic trends revealed by these data can then be related in time and space to previously proposed drivers for uplift, including plate rotation, change in convergence angle and rate, or the development of an accretionary prism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
72,Collaborative Research: Testing the timing and direction of mantle exhumation at the Iberia-Newfoundland margins with low-temperature thermochronology,"The change from continents to seafloor is an important tectonic process that leads to the formation of oceanic basins. Continental breakup results in extreme thinning of continental crust and exposure of mantle lithosphere to the seafloor before the start of seafloor spreading. The best-studied margin is the Iberia-Newfoundland margin in the North Atlantic. Previous work on the Iberia-Newfoundland margin provides the foundation for our understanding of the structure of these basins. However, multiple models have been proposed, each with slight differences. The timing, direction, and number of faults have direct implications on the evolution of these margins, as well as subsequent seawater alteration, which affects the habitability of the seafloor. This study will address questions on timing and structure of faulting that leads to separation of continents. This study will use the minerals apatite and zircon to evaluate the timing and direction of faulting, as well as when the margin cooled enough to allow key chemical reactions to occur. These key reactions are believed to be critical to understanding the evolution of life on Earth. The project will engage with a USC Communications PhD student to produce a podcast mini-series that explores the scientific research in this proposal and scientific communication practices for diverse audiences. In addition, a graduate student in the PIs lab will initiate the first Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) poster session for graduate and undergraduate students from the Department of Earth Sciences and Department of Marine and Environmental Biology at USC.<br/><br/>The complex interactions between faulting, magmatism, and serpentinization at hyper-extended margins have fueled geophysical, geochemical, and numerical modeling investigations for decades. However, there is still debate over first order questions about timing and mechanics of the transition from continental breakup to mantle exhumation and seafloor spreading. These include the temporal relationship of faults that accommodate mantle exhumation, the number and directionality of faults in the exhumed mantle section, and the thermal history of the lithosphere during mantle exhumation and seafloor alteration. This project is the first comprehensive low temperature thermochronology study to constrain the cooling history of the rocks exposed within and adjacent to the exhumed mantle section of the Iberia-Newfoundland margins, the only hyper-extended margin that has been systemically sampled. The project will use zircon and apatite recovered from igneous intrusions, syn-rift sediments, and exhumed continental crust from nine drill cores that make up a horizontal transect across the exhumed mantle section. These data will be used to track lithospheric cooling below ~200C (zircon (U-Th)/He) and ~80C (apatite (U-Th)/He), within the thermal window of serpentinization and ophicalcite formation, respectively. The results will be used to test proposed exhumation models and address three overarching research questions: 1) What is the temporal relationship between the faulting that accommodates mantle exhumation and seafloor spreading? 2) Was the mantle exhumed along one major detachment or multiple faults? 3) How does the timing of mantle exhumation faulting relate to other tectonic and petrologic processes, including the onset of seafloor spreading, serpentinization, and magmatism? These data will be used to evaluate whether faulting, serpentinization, and/or magmatism occurred over progressive exhumation from east to west or occurred in several locations simultaneously, with key implications for the transition from continental breakup to seafloor spreading and the relationship between magmatism, lithospheric extension, and mid-ocean ridge development. The rates and extents of serpentinization and ophicalcite formation will also have implications for understanding the development of conditions suitable for life on Earth. The project will engage with a USC Communications PhD student to produce a podcast mini-series that explores the scientific research in this proposal and scientific communication practices for diverse audiences. In addition, a graduate student in the PIs lab will initiate the first Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) poster session for graduate and undergraduate students from the Department of Earth Sciences and Department of Marine and Environmental Biology at USC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
73,Collaborative Research: Tracking nitrogen in mélange matrix from fore-arc to sub-arc depths with implications for deep nitrogen cycling: A combined field and experimental approach,"The nitrogen (N)-cycle as it relates to the bio-, atmo-, and hydro-spheres have been well studied due to N’s abundance in Earth’s atmosphere and importance for life. In the less understood solid Earth N cycle, plate tectonics has regulated N fluxes between surface and deep Earth reservoirs over much of Earth’s history, affecting the bulk Earth N distribution over millennial timescales. Thus, the mass balance of nitrogen (N) delivered to the deep Earth during subduction and then returned to the surface during volcanism and degassing is critically important, yet efficiency estimates are highly variable. Current estimates suggest that 45-74% of subducted N does not return to the surface through arc volcanism. This implies that N is being sequestered in the deep Earth in variable amounts, which could reflect factors such as subducting plate composition or subduction conditions. Candidates for deep, poorly characterized N reservoirs include mid-lower continental crust, subcontinental mantle, fore-arc to sub-arc mantle, or deeper mantle (i.e., deeper upper mantle, transition zone or lower mantle). This highlights a need for N measurements on appropriate samples as well as thorough constraints on N behavior in these reservoirs. New key constraints on nitrogen (N) distribution and processing within the fore-arc to sub-arc regions of subduction zones will be provided. First, some of the first N composition measurements of sediment-rich and serpentinite-rich mélange matrix rocks and minerals to characterize the distribution of N during fore-arc processing will be made. Second, phase equilibria experiments to assess the stability of key N hosting minerals and measure N melt/fluid-mineral partition coefficients on mélange-matrix materials as a function of several factors (pressure, temperature, oxygen fugacity, chlorine content, and partial melt composition) to track N behavior during dehydration and partial melting in the slab at sub-arc depths will be performed. Data from the proposed study along with those from previous studies will be used to quantify the amount of N that is delivered from the fore-arc to the sub-arc processing zone, in which minerals it is hosted, and how it varies by dominant lithology (sediment or serpentinite). How much N is released from the slab during sub-arc processing versus how much is sequestered in the sub-arc mantle in subduction zones of different thermal states will then be quantified. These will constitute novel constraints on N behavior that can be applied to subduction regimes throughout Earth’s history. Hence, it will also be used to address the feedback and evolution of N across the coupled solid Earth-atmosphere systems. This proposal supports two early career female PIs, two graduate students, and two+ undergraduates from University of Arizona (UA) and University of Southern California (USC). To enhance collaboration and broaden participation, the PIs will offer a joint virtual graduate seminar on deep volatile cycling including students at UA and USC. The team at UA will develop a museum display at UA’s Alfie Norville Gem & Mineral Museum on high pressure-high temperature geoscience research (including laboratory equipment and research applications).<br/><br/>As the most abundant constituent of the Earth’s atmosphere and as an essential ingredient of life, the behavior of nitrogen (N) in the present-day atmosphere, oceans, crust and biosphere (collectively known as the surficial reservoirs) have been relatively well-studied. However, the N composition of the Earth’s surficial reservoirs may not have remained the same throughout Earth’s history and this may have implications for early Earth climate and evolution of life. Nitrogen is exchanged between the Earth’s surficial reservoirs and the deep interior via plate tectonics, especially subduction zones. In subduction zones, N in the Earth’s crust (along with components from the atmosphere, ocean and biosphere) is pulled into the mantle or the interior of the Earth. Some proportion of the N from the mantle escapes back into the atmosphere and ocean by volcanic degassing. This N exchange between the surface and interior is not well-constrained and this proposed study aims to fulfill a key component of this knowledge gap. The N composition of typical subduction zone rocks will be measured to determine where N is hosted as pressure and temperature increase. Laboratory experiments at conditions in the Earth’s mantle will be performed to understand the behavior of N once the crust enters the mantle and melts. The objective is to eventually use these results to estimate how the N composition of the Earth’s mantle and atmosphere have changed through Earth’s history. This proposal supports two early career female PIs, two graduate students, and two+ undergraduates from University of Arizona (UA) and University of Southern California (USC). To enhance collaboration and broaden participation, the PIs will offer a joint virtual graduate seminar on the proposed theme including students from both institutions. The team at UA will develop a museum display at UA’s Alfie Norville Gem & Mineral Museum on plate tectonics connecting the surface and interior of the Earth, which would be an excellent medium to educate the public on state-of-the-art research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
74,Collaborative Research: CSR: Core: Medium: Scaling Unix/Linux Shell Programs,"The ‘shell’ is the glue that holds modern computer systems together: It is the programming language that connects components and manages systems; it is the quick-and-dirty language for writing scientific workflows and data analysis; it is the control hatch that offers skilled users direct access to their computer's inner-workings. Shell programming remains ubiquitous —steadily in the top 10 most popular programming languages— partly because it allows non-expert developers to combine components available in any programming language with little-to-no understanding of their internals. Unfortunately, this black-box, language-agnostic composition hinders automated acceleration of shell programs. This project will develop techniques to accelerate shell programs without requiring input from shell programmers and little-to-no input from the authors of individual components. This work's approach (1) builds on the real-world success of prior research by the PIs (that requires more user input), (2) brings together expertise in several subfields of computer science —parallel and distributed systems, programming languages, and formal methods— and (3) offers synergy. The individual techniques each offer significant benefits, but yield a transformative whole.<br/><br/>By enabling practical, push-button enhancement of a real-world, pervasively-used programming language, the proposed work promises to significantly accelerate existing and new shell programs without any effort from their developers, without any changes to existing infrastructure, and while maintaining compatibility with prior results. The shell's ubiquity means these speedups will have broad impact, especially in disciplines that use computing as a tool to solve problems in their respective fields, e.g., bioinformatics, data science, and economics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
75,NSF-BSF: Reactivation and sleep in visual and motor skill acquisition: learning beyond training,"What is the best way to learn new skills? Recent studies have revealed two ways in which learning can become faster and more efficient. Previous research has shown that after practicing a motor skill fully on the first day of training, you only need to do a few practice trials on the following days to ""reactivate"" what you have learned, in order to achieve the same amount of skill improvement as if you had practiced the skill fully every day. How such brief task reactivation facilitates learning remains enigmatic. Other studies have shown how sleep also helps with learning visual skills. The goal of this research project is to integrate these important findings, explore whether sleep after skill training enhances learning and to understand the neural basis of how memory reactivation and sleep work together to make skill learning more efficient. <br/><br/>In this collaborative US-Israel project, researchers investigate the neural mechanisms by which learning can be enhanced for both visual and motor skill learning and study whether offline processing during sleep compensates for the minimal amount of training (by only a few trials of task reactivation) during wakefulness. In addition to monitoring the learning progress of the participants in the study, their brain activity during sleep and their brain neurochemistry will also be measured. Specifically, this study examines neurochemical processing related to brain plasticity by non-invasively measuring a ratio between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain (E/I ratio) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The results may reveal how brief exposure to learned information via task reactivation can replace extensive training, uncover the basic behavioral and brain mechanisms linking task reactivation and sleep, and use that knowledge to develop better methods for more efficient sensory and motor skill learning.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cognitive Neuroscience Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
76,Collaborative Research: Halogen Behavior In the Pluton-to-Volcanic Arc System,"Halogen elements (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) are abundant, highly reactive elements in the atmosphere, oceans, and lithosphere. Halogens within Earth’s crust can affect magmatic properties and carry elements to form economic mineral deposits. Within volcanic arc systems, halogen elements are carried to depth by subducting crust and can travel within melts through the overriding crust and out at volcanoes. Estimates of halogen inputs at subduction zones and outputs through volcanic gases show a deficit that suggest a portion of halogens are trapped deep within the Earth. There are multiple possible reservoirs to host halogens that are not well characterized because they are too difficult to access and sample. One example is the magmatic system under volcanoes where concentrations of halogens in subsurface magma chambers and erupted volcanic rocks are not well known. This team will measure the full halogen suite in intrusive plutonic rocks and extrusive volcanic rocks from the same ancient arc system now exposed in the Sierra Nevada, California. This will allow them to address key open questions including: whether halogens are enriched in the plutonic magma chamber or erupted volcanic rock; where halogens are hosted within the rocks; and what impact halogens have on magmatic processes and mineral deposits at volcanic arcs. Through this research, the principal investigators and graduate students will design an undergraduate mineralogy and petrology class with accessibility, equity, and inclusion principles and engage in undergraduate students in research and safe, inclusive field experiences. A subset of the samples used for this study come from an historic collection. These samples will be digitized using 3D technology and created into an educational resource hosted on the Virtual Microscope public website.<br/><br/><br/>Halogen movement and reservoirs within the deep Earth are highly uncertain due to the lack of data from key reservoirs, namely, the fore-arc, deeply subducted slab residues, subcontinental mantle, and – the focus of this study – continental crust. Given halogen incompatibility in the mantle and affinity towards more evolved melts, continental crust is a potentially important reservoir; however, bulk rock compositions of plutonic and volcanic arc rocks are relegated to a handful of studies. This research will characterize the full halogen (Fl, Cl, Br, I) composition and behavior within an arc magmatic system by analyzing a suite of spatially-related plutonic and volcanic rocks that share similar chemical composition and age from the Sierra Nevada Arc. Specifically, this team will measure bulk rock halogen (Cl, F, Br, I) concentrations, in-situ mineral concentrations (F, Cl), and O and H-isotopes on a suite of geochemically well-characterized samples. This sample suite will be used to 1) determine whether halogens are concentrated in the plutonic or volcanic section within a single arc system, 2) identify where halogens are hosted (i.e., in minerals or other sites), and 3) assess the role of halogens in magmatic processes during the formation of continental crust. In order to interpret the role of processes, such as assimilation and hydrothermal alteration, on halogen behavior, they also propose to analyze a complimentary suite that includes lower crustal xenoliths, host wall rocks (e.g., schists, marbles), hydrothermally altered rocks and associated veins, and more mafic lithologies (e.g., gabbros) to strengthen our interpretations. The dataset will significantly contribute to what is known of bulk rock halogen compositions for continental arc crust, and be used with major element, trace element, and isotopic compositions to evaluate the impact of primary magmatic processes (e.g., crustal assimilation, fractional crystallization) on the halogen record and interpret overall halogen systematics through the arc magmatic system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
77,Collaborative Research: SUSCHEM: Engineering Polymer-Nanocatalyst Membranes for Direct Capture of CO2 and Electrochemical Conversion to C2+ Liquid Fuel,"There have been rising environmental concerns resulting from the increasing emission of greenhouse gasses like CO2. One effective way to manage CO2 level is to directly capture and convert CO2 from air to other carbon forms. The direct conversion of CO2 using air as feedstock to a reusable carbon product has been extremely difficult and current approaches often involve an additional energy-intensive step to produce pure CO2 as feedstock for subsequent catalytic conversion. This proposal will address the current unmet challenges to allow direct air capture with a minimum energy input on capture/release and sequential electroreduction of CO2 to value-added liquid fuels. The concept is based on the design of a novel bioinspired process. The central component is a cellulose-based membrane that is used directly for capture and separation of CO2 from air. This new capture reaction, not yet been studied previously, will provide a very powerful processing tool for direct air capture of CO2. To convert CO2 to a reusable form of carbon, a new class of earth-abundant cobalt catalyst (hexagonal close packed cobalt nanosheets) will be studied. The capture and conversion will be realized conveniently via the cellulose-graphene-cobalt system in which local basicity and CO2 proximity to the catalyst are rationally controlled to facilitate efficient electroreduction of CO2. Through collaborative efforts between Brown and UConn, the proposed studies will generate an innovative design of an all-in-one integrated system to realize sustainable CO2 capture and utilization.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop a novel electrochemical system for direct air capture and conversion of CO2 to ethanal and/or ethanol under ambient conditions. The system consists of natural cellulose and a new hexagonal cobalt nanosheet catalyst deposited on graphene, providing a highly conductive and porous polymer network where the two components work cooperatively in direct air capture and electroreduction of CO2. Hydroxyl-rich amorphous cellulose can capture CO2 in the form of metastable hemi-carbonates catalyzed by a base. These metastable hemi-carbonates can reversibly release CO2 upon pH change or gentle heating, providing an energy-efficient approach to CO2 capture and release, which is inspired by natural CO2 concentration mechanisms in photosynthesis. The released CO2 is in proximity of the robust cobalt nanosheet catalyst assembled on graphene and integrated into the cellulose membrane, which functions as a working electrode to carry out the selective electroreduction of CO2 to C2 products. A working flow-cell system will be demonstrated as an engineering approach to direct capture and conversion of CO2 with air as feedstock. The study will offer not only a new design concept on cellulose processing method and new fundamental knowledge on the cobalt nanosheet-promoted C-C coupling in the CO2 reduction reaction, but also an energy-efficient engineering solution to direct CO2 capture and conversion.<br/><br/>The portion of this project that will be completed at Brown University is jointly funded by the Electrochemical Systems Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
78,Collaborative Research: AF: Medium: Foundations of Anonymous Communication in Large-Scale Networks,"A major challenge in network communication is providing anonymity and privacy without significant increase in latency and message complexity. While it is known how to secure the contents of messages via proper encryption techniques, it is less clear how to ensure that who is communicating with whom remains private, too. Currently used anonymity technologies such as the Tor network (used by millions daily) are practical but do not provide provable anonymity guarantees; in fact, security researchers have demonstrated that Tor is vulnerable to a type of Internet attack called traffic analysis. How to guarantee anonymity without rendering current systems too impractical remains an open question of high relevance to many widely used applications. This project create and disseminates algorithms that implement rigorous and efficient solutions to anonymous communication. The project also includes educational initiatives at the graduate and undergraduate levels to build a bigger workforce in the crucial area of privacy, security and computer science more generally.<br/><br/>This project addresses the fundamental challenge of guaranteeing anonymity in network communications. Techniques for obscuring meta-information about who is communicating with whom, when, and for how long inevitably involve increased communication (e.g., by rerouting communication through intermediate nodes and/or adding decoy messages). This in turn may lead to network congestion and communication delays. Thus, a crucial question of both theoretical and practical importance is to understand the trade-offs between security and message complexity in network communications under various privacy measures and adversarial models. A second challenge is to design provably secure and efficient anonymous communication schemes in realistic communications scenarios, such as node churn and iterative two-way communications. The team of researchers will address these challenges along two facets: (1) Designing routing schemes so that traffic patterns, possibly altered by malicious nodes, do not reveal any metadata; and (2) Designing cryptographically secure tools (such as cryptographic onions) to secure data even when the network participants responsible for relaying it are potentially adversarial.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
79,Collaborative Research: RAPID--Characterizing the Water Isotope Signature of an El Nino Event for Paleoclimate and Hydroclimate Studies,"This project secures funds under the auspices of the Rapid Response Research (RAPID) program to take advantage of the strong-to-very strong El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecast for the water year 2023-2024 to establish a longitudinal array of precipitation and stream sampling stations to constrain the meteoric water delta oxygen-18, deuterium-excess, and delta oxygen-17 signal of a strong ENSO event. The researchers will sample precipitation and stream water monthly over the course of a year and analyze these samples for oxygen and hydrogen isotopes. They will also collect spot samples of small-stream waters across this same longitudinal transect during Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 and simulate the source and pathways of precipitation using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model while using spatial statistics to produce isoscapes of our stable isotope result across the southwestern United States (U.S.).<br/><br/>This research is premised on the idea that substantial uncertainty remains regarding how hydroclimate (including precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff) in the arid and semi-arid southwestern U.S. will respond to rising carbon dioxide and warmer temperatures considering that ENSO plays an outsize role in modifying wintertime southwestern U.S. hydroclimate. <br/><br/>There is a large body of data from research that examines how ENSO will change in response to warming, utilizing both Global Climate Model (GCM) projections of future climate and paleoclimate records but these data are poorly constrained. Much of the paleoclimate evidence of southwestern U.S. hydroclimate and its links to the ENSO comes from proxy records of past meteoric water oxygen isotopes, with the typical assumption that lower proxy delta oxygen-18 corresponds with greater wintertime moisture and a shift towards ENSO conditions. <br/><br/>Consequently, the ability to test the sensitivity of western U.S. hydroclimate to warming and its links with ENSO relies upon constraining the relationship between the ENSO and meteoric water delta oxygen-18 across the western U.S. This causal link, however, is not well-established for strong ENSO events that may dominate climate in the future. Furthermore, there is currently no data to understand how ENSO modifies delta oxygen-17 values, which is emerging as a promising analytical isotopic tool to constrain the role of moisture source dynamics and evaporative effects in carbonate and clay isotope archives of paleoclimate.<br/><br/>The potential broader impacts include supporting two graduate students and providing a long-term monitoring dataset for improving reconstructions of the strength and frequency of ENSO events in the past which will help constrain the range of variability observed in the region necessary for future forecasts. <br/><br/>The research fits well into the potentially transformative, high risk, and quick-response research imperative of the RAPID program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
80,"Collaborative Research: Using a Combined Basin Analysis, Isotopic, and Modeling Approach to Reconstruct the LGM through Early Holocene Hydroclimate for Glacial Lake Mojave.","Water is California’s (CA) most critical and unpredictable resource. As a predominantly agricultural economy, CA’s socioeconomic success and sustainability are closely tied to water availability. And as the United States' largest state economy, the health of CA is important to the health of the United States. To understand modern and future water availability, scientists look to the past to inform the future – a field of study called paleoclimatology. Arid environments like the Mojave Desert are especially sensitive to water availability. As a result, arid environments are excellent sites for studying past changes in the water cycle. This project will focus on Silver Lake (CA) and combine geological, hydrological, and modeling methods to examine the amplitude, magnitude, and frequency of changes in water availability across one of the most geologically recent and climatically dynamic periods in Earth’s history – the period from the Last Glacial Maximum (ca. 24,000 years before present) to the early Holocene (8,000 years before present). Most importantly, our novel and transdisciplinary methods will allow us to quantify past changes in water availability and assess the climatic drivers that cause these changes. Cal-State Fullerton and Santiago Canyon College (both Hispanic Serving Institutions) will partner with Brown University (a major research-active university) to create a diverse educational and research experience for a total of 15 funded students and 1 post-doc. This multi-institutional collaboration provides a clear pathway for 2-year college students to transfer into 4-year universities and establishes a positive science identity and a sense of belonging in underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>This research will use a combined basin analysis (i.e.,core-to-shore), isotopic, and modeling approach to reconstruct a quantitative record of minimum lake depth, minimum lake volume, and the requisite hydroclimatic conditions during the Late Glacial to Early Holocene necessary to fill the Silver Lake Basin, the ostensible terminal basin of Glacial Lake Mojave. Existing and new beach or near-shore geomorphic sites will be identified and characterized using UAV-based, Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry. These shore data, and their respective ages, will be coupled with dated and analyzed sediment cores to quantify changes in minimum lake depth, and thus lake volume, from 24-8 ka. Coupled with these geological data, the project team will apply oxygen isotopic constrained, non-steady state hydrologic models of the lake system to quantify the requisite conditions necessary to fill and sustain Silver Lake during the Late Glacial to Early Holocene. Finally, the results from this work will be compared to a variety of climatic forcings to evaluate the primary drivers of hydroclimatic change in the southern Great Basin.

81,MRI: Track 1 Acquisition of a replacement electron microprobe at Brown University,"The instrument that will be funded provides a fast, easy way to analyze the chemical composition of most solids. It does not destroy or affect the sample, and can analyze spots as small as one micron (50 times smaller than the width of human hair). Sample preparation is simple, and does not involve toxic chemicals, and an analysis takes between 2 and 6 minutes. In addition to its ability to analyze chemical composition, the instrument can also image the sample at the micron-scale. These qualities make it incredibly useful to a wide range of scientists, from geology and planetary science, to engineering, chemistry and biology, to archaeology and even art history and preservation. Because it does not involve using hazardous chemicals or complex, multi-step sample preparation, it is also a great tool for teaching and for summer research projects, including programs aimed at increasing diversity in the field.<br/><br/>The funds will be used to purchase a state-of-the-art, 5-spectrometer electron microprobe with EDS and CL detectors. This will replace the existing (now failing) microprobe that has been highly productive, and highly used, over its 20+ year history, serving researchers in a wide range of fields. The microprobe has been an integral part of both graduate and undergraduate education. The goal is to continue and expand this success, maintaining an open and high-quality microprobe facility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
82,Collaborative Research: HNDS-I:SweetPea: Automating the Implementation and Documentation of Unbiased Experimental Designs,"Two important issues facing modern empirical research are those of transparency (how well others can figure out how the research was done) and replicability (whether the outcomes will be the same if someone else does the same experiments). Lack of transparency and failures of experiments to replicate stifle scientific progress and lead to a mistrust of the scientific method. This project develops an open-source programming language, SweetPea, that automates experimental design. It will help researchers understand and replicate the results of others, minimize errors and bias, and increase the efficiency and accuracy of the entire experimental process. Consequently, this technology will contribute to advancing scientific discoveries, make them more accessible and reliable, and provide researchers in empirical sciences with a valuable tool to aid their work.<br/><br/>Many replication problems in the behavioral sciences arise because of the challenges encountered in implementing accurate and appropriately balanced experimental designs while avoiding confounding factors. Additionally, the lack of clear and transparent documentation reduces transparency and the ability to replicate experimental results. The SweetPea programming language is designed to facilitate reproducible experimental design. This project extends SweetPea's core functionality to support various design strategies, automating the documentation process, and expanding the community of users and contributors. SweetPea uses an intuitive interface for the declarative expression of experimental designs, and advanced computational algorithms for sampling and analysis. The software ensures that experimental designs are properly implemented without introducing unexpected confounds. In addition, the project leverages large language models for robust documentation of experimental designs. The project includes outreach activities to engage psychologists, neuroscientists, behavioral economists, and machine learning experts. Overall, this project improves the accuracy, transparency, and replicability of experimental designs, offering researchers an accessible and powerful tool for scientific investigation.

83,Collaborative Research: RI: Medium: Bridging the Semantic-Metric Gap via Multinocular Image Integration,"Humans and other animals can effortlessly and subconsciously reconstruct the 3D world around them from the video imagery streaming to their eyes, and successfully use it for navigation, food-finding, predator avoidance, etc. Computer vision 3D technology has been evolving rapidly to reconstruct the world from a set of cameras and locate these cameras in the environment. This technology is a basis of navigation as in automated driving, robot navigation, and drone flights; a basis of manipulation as in robotic manufacturing, robotic medical interventions, etc.; measurement in metrology; modeling for the entertainment industry; and a host of other applications. As a result, 3D vision has experienced an exponential growth in capability, efficiency, and robustness. Despite this phenomenal growth arising from exploiting what is currently achievable, fundamental shortcomings exist that need to be addressed to enlarge the scope of application and to increase robustness in existing ones. First, images from rapidly moving cameras (e.g., drones and pedestrians) are often blurry and lack features; indoor scenes and others which have textureless surfaces or surfaces with repeated texture lack features or have indistinguishable features; and there are other examples which are often beyond the capabilities of current technologies. Second, image sensing typically enjoys a high degree of redundancy which is often discarded in current algorithms, thus forfeiting the opportunity to use the high information content inherent in the redundancy. Third, there is often a large gap between the internal representations used in the current technology, which are often point-based, and a semantic representation of the scene, which are more resonant with an understanding of underlying curves (e.g., ridges) and surface patches (faces) of an object. This project aims to remedy these shortcomings.<br/><br/>Several technical challenges need to be addressed to achieve these goals. First, this project identifies that the notion of numerical stability, currently confounded with degeneracy, should be thoroughly studied and analyzed for key multiview geometry (MVG) tasks. The stability requirement leads to a new class of techniques which will be implemented and made readily available to the community to help avoid failure modes in a broad selection of MVG problems. Second, the development of tools to solve very large polynomial systems is an enabling technology that will transform not just multiview geometry problems, but also a broad range problem from other scientific areas. Third, these developments will enable a novel MVG approach based on curves, surfaces, and their differential geometry for relative pose estimation, absolute pose estimation, and 3D reconstruction. This will serve to bridge the semantic-metric gap that exists between geometrically accurate 3D point clouds/meshes and semantically meaningful organizations in terms of objects, object parts, spatial layout, mapping, etc. In conjunction, these three streams of research will allow direct, eﬀicient and reliable integration of information across a large number of views in multinocular vision systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
84,"CAREER: Mapping class groups, diffeomorphism groups, and moduli spaces","Topology is the study of spaces and their fundamental properties. Related to this project, there are two foundational principles. First, a given space can be fruitfully probed by understanding its symmetries. Second, if one wants to study some collection of spaces (for a simple example, think of polygons in the plane), then it can be helpful to turn this collection of spaces into a single space (often called a moduli space) whose properties are illuminating. For the educational component, the PI will organize topology workshops with the aim of introducing graduate students to active areas of research and giving them tools to contribute to these areas. The PI will orchestrate summer directed reading programs that will help prepare undergraduate students for research and broaden participation. Finally, the PI will continue his outreach to high school students through math circles. Support from this grant will help increase teacher involvement through events hosted on campus.<br/><br/>This project is concerned with group actions on manifolds and moduli spaces. Regarding group actions, the focus is on determining when a group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms can be realized as a group of homeomorphisms. This problem, known as Nielsen realization, dates back to the work of Nielsen in the early 1900s and has connections to dynamics, foliation theory, and the geometry of manifolds and fiber bundles. The moduli spaces of interest in this proposal relate to low-dimensional topology and nonpositive curvature. A central goal is to compute new homological and homotopical invariants of the moduli spaces of interest. The specific research project are as follows. (1) Solve Nielsen realization problems for 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds. (2) Study finite groups actions on aspherical manifolds with exotic smooth structures using rigidity results related to the Borel conjecture. (3) Show non-triviality of twist tori in the homology of finite covers of moduli space by reducing the problem to tropical geometry and combinatorics. (4) Construct new characteristic classes of surface bundles using the curve complex. (5) Compute homotopy groups of embedding spaces for high dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, building on work of Farrell-Jones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
85,Nonlocal Terahertz Nanospectroscopy and Nanoimaging,"In many emerging material systems which will be important for future device applications, the propagation of charges at the material surface can be the key determining factor in device performance. For example, devices based on gallium nitride, which includes most blue LEDs and blue diode lasers, are often limited in their performance by crystalline defects at their surfaces or interfaces, which perturb the transport of electrons between adjacent layers of the materials. In another example, the boundaries between crystalline micro-grains in a polycrystalline film of light-harvesting materials used in solar cells can strongly influence the speed at which charges created by absorbed sunlight are collected, ultimately setting a limit on the device efficiency. This project seeks to develop a suite of new experimental techniques to study such issues, with both high spatial and temporal resolution. These techniques rely on the very strong interaction between the charges moving in the material and electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz spectral range. In some cases, these moving charges can radiate an ultrashort burst of terahertz radiation, which contains important signatures of the charge carrier dynamics. In other cases, a short terahertz pulse reflected from the material surface can be used to characterize the properties of the mobile charges, with temporal resolution on the scale of a picosecond. Our work will extend these ideas to the nanoscale realm, allowing us to study the charge transport using terahertz techniques with spatial resolution of only a few tens of nanometers.<br/><br/>The aim of this research program is to demonstrate revolutionary new measurement techniques in terahertz nanoscopy, and use them to glean new information about dynamical processes in materials. In particular, we will establish the idea of non-local THz nanoscopy, by developing a suite of methods such as non-local optical-pump THz-probe nanoscopy and non-local THz emission nanoscopy. We will then use these new experimental techniques in studies of several material systems of current technological relevance. We will initiate collaborations to leverage the expertise of colleagues in sample preparation and calculations of THz material properties. The proposed research will significantly advance the field of terahertz nanoscience by bringing the power of nonlinear optics to the nanoscale with sub-picosecond temporal resolution and nanoscale spatial resolution. Unlike traditional nanoscopy techniques, our new methods will reveal information about lateral charge transport, rather than vertical transport. We will study the transport of polaritons across an individual step edge in a multi-layer graphene film, and probe the effects of an individual grain boundary on charge transport in a polycrystalline perovskite thin film. We will also couple these new ideas to cutting-edge results in terahertz vibrational spectroscopy, by studying the effects of local nanoscale defects on vibrational modes with mesoscopic coherence lengths, and by observing the influence of nanoscale excitations on simple chemical reactions mediated by terahertz vibrations. These measurements will open up new possibilities for the study of nanoscale phenomena in materials, revealing important information that cannot be obtained using other methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another focus of this project is the contact process on random networks, aiming to understand the dynamics of contagion as it spreads through complex interconnected systems. This work will provide insight into real-world epidemics and information dissemination, leading to the development of more effective strategies for controlling and preventing the spread of infections or ideas. This research project seeks to deepen our understanding of these ubiquitous random structures and to explore their applications in real-world problems. Graduate and undergraduate students will be mentored as part of this project, and the research findings will be disseminated through publications and research talks, reaching a wide audience.<br/><br/>More specifically, this research project will investigate the universality of variances and higher moments of the number of real roots, along with the asymptotic distribution of this number. To achieve this, various universality techniques will be used to develop new tools and connections. Regarding the contact process, the project specifically focuses on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and will explore the phase transition of the survival time. Novel ideas and methods will be pursued to rigorously analyze the SIS contact process.

In this award, new tracers are being created by controlling the way small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles organize into larger clusters using polymers that are created from natural amino acids. Cluster properties such as particle spacing and spatial arrangement are used to manipulate and maximize the tracer response for Magnetic Particle Imaging. This collaborative project will be conducted by investigators from the University of Rhode Island, the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and Brown University. This interdisciplinary and multi-institutional project is an excellent platform for engaging students and broadening participation, which will be achieved by partnering with National Science Foundation Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation programs in Rhode Island and Alabama. Students will be trained in technical, professional, and science communication skills.<br/><br/>Magnetic Particle Imaging is an emerging medical diagnostic technique that exploits the unique magnetic properties and biocompatible nature of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as ‘tracers’ for the generation of three-dimensional images of tissues. Two key challenges to facilitating research translation to clinical settings include preparing particle tracers for maximum exploitation of their superparamagnetic characteristics and their target-specific derivatization and utilizing biocompatible particle surface coatings and assembly agents to avoid adverse outcomes. This award involves a new approach to tracer design based on the controlled clustering of hydrophobic particles using poly(amino acid) corrals. Specific aims include designing and synthesizing poly(amino acids) with varying hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and stabilizing block domains; demonstrating controllable nanoparticle assembly as a function of poly(amino acid) composition; and evaluating the magnetic properties of the clusters using a custom magnetic particle spectrometer. The approach to Magnetic Particle Imaging tracer design is potentially transformative and expected to help advance Magnetic Particle Imaging as a tool for disease diagnosis and treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
88,Electrically-driven silicon single-photon source,"Quantum light sources are enablers of quantum information processing, communications, sensing and imaging. Further progress demands single-photon sources that are electrically-driven (i.e. electrically triggered), emit at a low-loss telecom wavelength, and can be miniaturized and integrated with silicon electronic circuits. This project aims to pilot the development of such single-photon sources that are not yet available. Success in this endeavor would represent an unprecedented advance in the field and would help<br/>push the boundaries of quantum information technology, which in turn could lead to expansion of our capabilities in advancing optical and materials sciences in the quantum domain. In so doing, the proposed effort will also catalyze transformative advances of our engineering education and training programs towards quantum technologies, thereby not only impacting the training of postdocs, graduates, and undergraduates.<br/><br/>The proposed effort leverages a prior limit-breaking effort in generating bright stimulated emission in the telecom O-band (~1.3 μm) from a crystalline silicon patterned with periodically distributed G-centers – also known as the carbon-silicon ‘color-center’. This project too will push the boundary, but to the opposite limit – i.e. to electrically-pumped single-photon emission, which is unprecedented in silicon and monochromatic (zero-phonon). Enabled by the innovative nanopatterning of a Si crystal with a 2D periodic array of nanoscale holes, it would create a periodic distribution of G-centers embedded in the sidewall of the nanohole which is also mechanically strained and bandgap lowered. As demonstrated in our earlier reports, this would allow one to create the emissive G-centers with little increase in the overall optical loss while simultaneously channeling the injected charge carriers to the G-centers for recombination and emission. Furthermore, the periodic patterning will be designed in such a way that the spontaneous emission rate can be enhanced via the Purcell effect. This will be achieved by engineering the structure and periodicity of the nano-hole array to create a photonic crystal with a small mode volume and a high density of photon states to peak at/near the frequency of the G-center emission. An extra enhancement can be achieved by blocking the leakage hole current with a thin barrier layer while still allowing electrons to tunnel through. The photon collection efficiency will be maximized with both the holey low-index silicon layer and the transparent electrode as well as the design of the photonic crystal structure (nanohole array) with the stop band in the lateral direction and the emission cone in the perpendicular direction. The top electrodes, also to be patterned into an array of macroscopic sizes, would allow selective pumping of individual SPS zones so as to allow selection of single-photon emitters that are brightest, monochromatic and yet still satisfy the single-photon criterion. These measures are expected to provide us the first-ever, arrayed, electrically-pumped, monochromatic silicon single-photon sources in the telecom O-band that are compatible to and ready for integration with silicon electronics for quantum information processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
89,Rare Events and High-Dimensional Stochastic Systems,"Large collections of interacting random elements arise in many areas, ranging from physics and neuroscience to engineering and operations research. It is of great importance to study fluctuations and large deviations from the typical or mean behavior of these systems. Indeed, fluctuations and atypical events, although rare, can have significant impact, so it is important to quantify these probabilities and to understand typical occurrences of rare events. A significant mathematical challenge is to see how the structure of interaction between large collections of stochastic elements influences the nature of such deviations. This project will address this challenge for three classes of stochastic systems. The first class consists of large collections of interacting diffusions that arise as models of stock prices in finance, as continuum models of population dynamics in biology, and in statistical physics. The second class concerns high-dimensional measures, such as random ensembles of matrices arising as representations of high-dimensional data, and their relation to lower-dimensional projections, which are used as a dimension-reduction technique when analyzing data. Understanding the statistics and deviations of lower-dimensional projections is not only relevant for statistics and data science but also has significance for some open conjectures in convex geometry. The third class pertains to the study of fluctuations of eigenvectors of random matrices and addresses hypotheses related to quantum mechanical systems. The project will include vertically integrated mentoring of junior researchers at multiple levels and outreach efforts to foster broadening the mathematical participation of underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. <br/><br/>This project will study high-dimensional stochastic systems and work to characterize fluctuations and large deviations from mean behavior and the nature of rare events in such systems. Three classes of problems will be considered. The first focuses on large collections of diffusions whose local interaction structure is governed by an underlying graph, and aims to study their atypical or large deviation behavior. While this has been well understood for almost half a century in the case when the underlying graph is the complete graph, the goal of this project is to study the complementary case when the graphs are (uniformly) sparse, which is also the relevant regime for many applications. This will require a combination of tools from random graph theory, stochastic analysis and variational methods. The second class of problems relates to the study of concentration and large deviation behavior of projections of high-dimensional convex bodies, with a focus on non-commutative settings, such as the level sets of norms of Banach spaces of matrices such as the p-Schatten spaces. The relation to some outstanding conjectures in convex geometry will also be explored. The third theme concerns the study of universality of the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis from physics, which is a statement about eigenvectors of random matrices, and corresponding fluctuations. These problems address fundamental problems in probability theory and have applications to statistical physics, asymptotic convex geometry and statistics. The project will employ a combination of analytical, geometric and probabilistic methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
90,Collaborative Research: Evolution of ligand-dependent Robo receptor activation mechanisms for axon guidance,"The connections between the information-processing cells of our nervous system are formed by long extensions of these cells called axons. The growth and guidance of axons toward their correct target cells is a critical step in neural circuit assembly during embryonic development. One important group of proteins that reside on growing axons and control their guidance is called Robos. This collaborative study will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of Robo family proteins for axon steering, and it will also determine how Robos have changed over the course of evolution to allow the wiring of nervous systems with increasing complexity. By providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of axon pathfinding, this work can improve our understanding of disorders resulting from nervous system miswiring, and it has the potential to inform therapeutic approaches for neural circuit repair. The project will involve undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge research, with an emphasis on the career development of women and underrepresented minorities. It also includes outreach to Providence, RI, and Chicago, IL, public high schools by hosting students in research laboratories and helping them gain early experience in developmental neurobiology research.<br/><br/>The Slit-Robo ligand-receptor pair is an evolutionarily ancient signaling module that controls axon crossing of the nervous system midline in bilaterians by mediating repulsion. Yet, our understanding of the signaling mechanisms of Robo and Slit homologs and other associated proteins remains incomplete. Further complicating the picture is a divergent Robo family member, mammalian Robo3, which cannot bind Slits but is essential for axon crossing of the spinal cord midline. Previous work discovered a secreted Robo3 ligand, NELL2, which guides commissural axons via repulsion. Preliminary results indicate that the formation of an active NELL2-Robo3 complex is mechanistically distinct from Slit-Robo interactions and that, in mammals, Robo3 and the canonical Robos, Robo1, and Robo2, evolved from a dual ligand-binding ancestor at the root of the vertebrate tree. The driving hypothesis for the proposed studies is that the functional specialization of mammalian Robo family members is crucial for circuit wiring. This project integrates the expertise of two investigators in structural/biophysical and functional/genetic approaches to investigate Robo signaling and evolution. Ancient sequence reconstruction, biochemical methods, and axon guidance assays will be used to map the evolutionary history of Robo ligand binding and signaling capabilities. Further, structural approaches, structure-based mutagenesis, biophysical methods, and axon guidance assays will be combined to determine the contributions of Robo ligand binding site divergence, extracellular domain conformation, and molecular crowding to ligand-receptor complex formation and signaling in mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. The project will provide training to students at all levels and include outreach activities, with a research focus, at local high schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
91,RII Track-2 FEC: Community-Driven Coastal Climate Research & Solutions for the Resilience of New England Coastal Populations,"The ""Community-Driven Coastal Climate Research & Solutions (3CRS)"" project is a significant and timely initiative that addresses the pressing issue of climate change in low-lying, working waterfront communities in New England. These communities, which are deeply intertwined with ocean resources, are disproportionately vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. With large parts of these communities, including critical infrastructure, projected to be increasingly impacted by nuisance flooding and potentially permanently underwater by the end of the century, the need for climate adaptation strategies is urgent. The project's importance lies in its focus on developing a scalable and transferable framework for such strategies, thereby enhancing coastal resilience. Specifically, the project aims at developing the knowledge, data, modeling, and human network infrastructure to support a New England Hub for coastal climate resilience that is community-driven. This aligns directly with the NSF's mission to promote the progress of science to advance national health, prosperity, and welfare. The 3CRS Hub seeks to address and explore solutions for the intersect of fundamental issues of poverty, limited healthcare access, inadequate infrastructure, and limited climate change adaptation capacity in waterfront communities. Beyond addressing these immediate challenges, the project also holds potential for broader societal benefits. It aims to advance the field of climate resilience, support education and diversity through the mentorship of early career scientists, and benefit society by increasing the resilience of communities that play a crucial role in the nation's economy and cultural heritage.<br/><br/>The 3CRS project is designed to tackle three key research challenges for climate resilience planning. The first challenge is to identify and measure dynamic changes in human health, wellbeing, habitability, environment, and other climate vulnerabilities. This involves a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between climate change and various socio-economic factors that influence community resilience. The second challenge is to downscale climate models outputs and information to the community level and project the impacts of climate resilience for planners. This requires sophisticated modeling techniques (e.g. dynamical and AI-based) that can translate large-scale climate models projections into actionable information at the community level. The third challenge is to expand the capacity to incorporate data, knowledge, and expert networks into community resilience planning processes. This involves building robust systems for data collection, analysis, and dissemination, as well as fostering strong relationships with expert networks. To address these challenges, the project will develop a Community Knowledge Collective, which will co-produce three primary knowledge streams: observational data, community-driven metrics of resilience, and climate adaptation narratives. A novel tool, the New England-wide Coastal Hazards Analysis Modeling and Prediction System (NE-CHAMP), will be deployed to enable communities to visualize and analyze the impacts of present and future climate on critical infrastructure, health, socio-economic, and other community-driven resilience metrics. In the final phase of the project, a series of shared resilience roadmaps will be produced that digitally document the transferable processes for developing coastal adaptation strategies, thereby providing a blueprint for other communities facing similar challenges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
92,Updating technical components to sustain XMAPortal and ZMAPortal for the comparative biomechanics research community,"The X-ray Motion Analysis Portal (XMAPortal) and the Zoological Motion Analysis Portal (ZMAPortal) provides a critical resource for a broad range of faculty and students from diverse institutions including US universities, primarily undergraduate colleges, international institutions, and small businesses. With support from this award, the Portals will be updated to benefit research in the field of comparative biomechanics through; (1) continued availability of video data and metadata already deposited in the Portals; and (2) updating the Portals to receive new data from the growing number of researchers using video to study the biomechanics of movement in living animals. As scientific cyberinfrastructure, the XMAPortal and ZMAPortal provide video data management to increase the efficiency of lab groups and collaborations, and they also serve as data archives for data re-use, validation, and transparency. Undergraduate students will learn about cyberinfrastructure by participating in alpha and beta testing. This project will advance scientific infrastructure and human STEM workforce development in support of scientific innovation and long-term US economic competitiveness.<br/><br/>A cyberinfrastructure update is needed because of external technology changes that have occurred since the development of the XMA and ZMA Portals started nearly 15 years ago. The proposed update will make it possible to continue to sustain the Portals with user fees for the next 15-20 years. The XMA and ZMAPortals will be refactored to leverage the latest modern Javascript web development frameworks. Modern Javascript shifts focus away from specific technologies to user facing functionality, and user experience is decoupled from data. Modern Javascript is less prescriptive about how applications are maintained and deployed, allowing the use of new deployment tools that can dynamically scale with the incoming traffic to the XMAPortal and ZMAPortal. All code will be containerized and deployed with Kubernetes, an open-source container-orchestration tool. The code developed for this project will be open source and available to the scientific community. By updating the technology base of the existing Portals, the continuity of these video data management platforms will be ensured for many years to come. The impact on the research community will be to maintain the video data already stored in the portals while enabling new research in the field of comparative biomechanics through synthesis, data mining, and sharing of highly data-rich video files.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
93,Fostering STEM Engagement from Parent-Child Interaction,"Children’s engagement and learning in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) is fundamental to developing a more scientifically literate society. The ways parents and children interact around STEM activities sets the stage for how children might become engaged in STEM. This project will investigate the relation between the ways parents and children interact during at-home STEM activities, children’s understanding of their interaction, and children’s engagement with and learning around that activity. The team will study at-home STEM activities for parents and children between the ages of 3 and 8, looking particularly at the way parent-child interaction relates to children’s persistence with challenging tasks. The main hypothesis of the study is that the more parents set goals for the interaction with their children, the less autonomy children believe they have in performing the activity, resulting in lower levels of child engagement. <br/><br/>This research involves two phases of experimental studies with parent-child dyads randomly assigned to different conditions. The first set of studies will look at naturalistic interactions between 360 dyads during an at-home STEM activity about the surface tension of water. The team will investigate the ways children reflect on their participation, to consider how their understanding of their own autonomy relates to their engagement with water-based activities, such as washing their hands. A second set of experimental studies expands these ideas to a new group of 360 dyads, to examine persistence with challenging, structured activities around specific engineering concepts. Children will then be given age-appropriate challenging problems related to those activities. Researchers will study the extent to which the autonomy communicated by parents during the activity, and children’s metacognitive understanding of their participation relates to their engagement and persistence with those challenging tasks. Moreover, in both lines of studies, the team will examine whether nudging parents to communicate more autonomy to their children during the interaction promotes further persistence or engagement. Observational data will be coded and analyzed using generalized linear models to control for relevant factors related to age and child characteristics. Taken together, these studies advance understanding of how naturalistic parent-child interaction during informal learning at home relates to children’s engagement with STEM.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
94,A physics-based neural network approach for geophysical inversions,"Geophysical imaging has contributed to much of our understanding of the Earth and its geologic, tectonic, and volcanic history. However, most geophysical imaging utilizes single data types rather than using multiple data types jointly, resulting in images that can be incompatible with other data. Such incompatibilities can lead to misleading or erroneous inferences about the Earth and the underlying geophysical processes. This project investigates a method for allowing seamless usage of both gravity and seismic data jointly by leveraging new artificial intelligence tools that have physics based constraints. The method promises to be easily and efficiently applied to many different geophysical imaging problems and therefore potentially improve our understanding of Earth’s tectonic history. In other contexts, the enhanced images may help determine how to best respond to natural hazards like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. This work also helps connect the artificial intelligence and geophysics scientific communities, two communities that would benefit from more interactions with each other. In addition, the project supports graduate and undergraduate students, as well as outreach efforts in the Providence public schools that includes minority and low-income high school students.<br/><br/>Joint inversions that robustly minimize the tradeoffs inherent in using different types of geophysical data are challenging to implement, in part due to the specialized expertise needed for each data type, the unique difficulties in setting up each type of inversion, and the quantity of data and simulations that must be analyzed as part of such studies. Machine learning has made great strides in addressing all three of the above challenges, but it still often remains computationally impractical to implement robustly and this is true of joint inversions of full-waveform seismic and gravity data. This work uses a new machine learning framework called physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to implement joint inversions of such data. The PINN framework leverages an understanding of the underlying physical model to reduce the cost of building a neural network to accurately approximate the wave propagation or Poisson equation governing the relevant data. One test target of the PINN-based joint inversion methodology is using field data from the Los Angeles Basin, where numerous prior in situ geological and structural field data can be used to test whether the joint inversion accomplishes the goal of improving the resolution of true geologic features. <br/><br/>This project is co-funded by the Directorate for Geosciences to support AI/ML advancement in the geosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
95,Doctoral Dissertation Research in Economics: Algorithmic Bias and Dynamics of Hate Speech on Social Media,"This award supports research on social media algorithms that lead to hate speech and polarization on these platforms. It is thought that the sharp increase in hate speech around the world is partly caused by social media algorithms that amplifies such hate speech. However, researchers have not been able to test whether this is the case or not for lack of appropriate data. Working with one of the largest social media platform in the world, the researchers will study the effects of algorithmic recommendations on increased hate speech and the cumulative effects of past exposure to hateful content prompted by algorithms on current user engagement with such social media posts. The use of experimental methods will allow the researchers to disentangle the effects of user preferences for hate speech from the effects of algorithmic amplification of hate speech. The results of this research will provide important inputs into policies to reduce hateful speech on social media platforms and thus establish the US as a global leader in reducing hate speech on social media. <br/><br/><br/>Algorithmic recommendations are widely used to tailor content to users’ preferences on social media platforms leading to amplification of some messages, yet little is known about the causal effect of these algorithms on hateful speech. The algorithms expose different users to specific kinds of content based on their innate preferences over social content. These preferences are not observed by the researcher but are learned by the algorithm over time. This project investigates the influence of algorithmic recommendation systems on the amplification of engagement with hate speech. To accomplish this, the researchers will conduct a large-scale RCT in collaboration with one of the largest social media platforms in the world. In this experiment, content recommendations will be switched off for a random set of users. As a result, a large number of users will be exposed to content that is chosen randomly from the entire corpus of posts. The researchers hypothesize that the effect of past exposure on sharing of current content will cause algorithmic customization to be more polarizing than it would be in the absence of such dynamic effects. The results of this research will provide important inputs into policies to reduce hateful speech on social media platforms and thus establish the US as a global leader in reducing hate speech on social media.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
96,EA: Acquisition of an IRMS for sulfur isotope measurements,"This grant will support the acquisition of a state-of-the-art mass spectrometer. The instrument will be used in Dr. Dottin’s research program as a new faculty member at Brown University in the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences. Sulfur, the sixteenth element on the periodic table, has 4 stable isotopes (32S, 33S, 34S and 36S). Ratios of these isotopes that are measured in a variety of rock materials often provide fingerprints associated with how the rock materials have been processed throughout geologic time. Such can also provide insights into the different planetary evolutionary processes that have occurred through time. The proposed project focuses on the acquisition of a state-of-the-art instrument capable of measuring the ratios of sulfur isotopes at high precision. The instrument will primarily be used for research associated with (1) understanding the origin and evolution of sulfur in the deep Earth, (2) placing constraints on the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere, and (3) ultimately deconvoluting the complexities related to interactions among Earth’s atmosphere, surface, and interior. The instrument also will be used as a teaching tool. It is anticipated that undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs will use the instrument for their respective projects. They will be trained in the operation and troubleshooting of the instrument. The instrument also will be incorporated in upper-level undergraduate/graduate courses that will allow students exposure to gas source mass spectrometry and an opportunity to work in an isotope laboratory within a class setting.<br/><br/>The awarded proposal contains a request for an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) that will be used to determine sulfur isotope compositions of rocks from a variety of Earth reservoirs. Acquisition of an IRMS will support the research program of PI (Dottin), who will begin an assistant professorship at Brown University July 1, 2023. The analytical tasks that will be accomplished with the state-of-the-art IRMS will broadly cover studying the quadruple isotopic composition of sulfur that exists in multiple earth reservoirs to identify the processes associated with the cycling of sulfur among the Earth’s interior, surface, and atmosphere, and the timescales on which these processes occur. Specifically, Dottin plans to use the instrument to: (1) determine the nature and relative age of recycled components erupted among Ocean Island Basalts; (2) place detailed constraints on the sulfur isotope composition of the primordial mantle; and (3) to use S isotopes to track the evolution of Earth’s continental crust across the Archean-Proterozoic boundary. The instrument will contain state-of-the-art technology and can be fit with a unique set of collectors that will allow for the acquisition of high-precision measurements of the minor isotopes of sulfur. Beyond the scope of strictly acquiring data, the instrument will be connected to efforts that are rooted in education, training, and diversification of the geosciences. The instrument requested will be used to support research performed by undergraduate students at Brown University and summer research undergraduate students actively recruited from HBCU’s and other minority-serving institutions. Additionally, the instrument will be used as an educational/training tool. Graduate students will be trained in the proficient operation and maintenance of the instrument and the PI (Dottin) plans to develop courses that use the instrument as a teaching aid to expose a wide audience of students to gas source mass spectrometry and geochemistry laboratory applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
97,Collaborative Research: FieldSafe - Changing the Culture of Fieldwork in the Geosciences,"Field-based research is integral to many geoscience research programs and can present unique challenges for scientists and other participants. Fieldwork is often conducted in teams that include established researchers and their students, which introduces complex power dynamics. These conditions create challenges and stressors that increase vulnerability to hostile behaviors such as bullying, harassment, and other identity-based exclusionary behaviors. The need to address safety, identity-based harassment and other exclusionary behaviors in field campaigns is growing more urgent to ensure safe and productive research environments. This work supports the field-based geoscience community by increasing field team preparedness and changing fieldwork team culture to be inclusive, supportive, welcoming, discrimination-free and productive. The project is a synergistic effort between FieldSafe and the ADVANCEGeo Partnership to support researchers in meeting the new NSF proposal requirement for the inclusion of a field safety plan in all field-based proposals, and to support institutional change initiatives in other research funding agencies and at academic institutions. This is especially novel because, to date, no research has been conducted on the effectiveness of training focused on field safety and/or anti-harassment and tools for the design of inclusive field campaigns.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to (1) create and widely disseminate a field safety, anti-harassment, and bystander intervention training certificate program through an online course platform, (2) develop a toolkit to support field teams in planning safe and inclusive field campaigns and (3) research the impact of these trainings and support tools for field culture change. This project produces new knowledge of the effectiveness of a program that utilizes a combined self-paced online course combined with synchronous guided debrief and reflection sessions to support the development of inclusive culture in all field environments. The results of this project will contribute a robust and transferable research design and instruments to study the culture and safety of fieldwork. The research will contribute important findings around critical components for the instructional sequence and implementation of training and how the application of this training may vary based on different field contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
98,Collaborative Research: Investigating intraplate melting processes in northwest New Zealand with seismic imaging,"While most of Earth’s volcanoes occur at the boundaries between tectonic plates, many others occur within plate interiors. Some of these intraplate volcanoes, such as those in Hawaii, are linked to hot mantle that flows upward from depths of more than 2500 km in the lower mantle. Others, however, have more enigmatic origins. One group of volcanoes in the enigmatic category erupt lavas whose chemistry is consistent with melting of rocks at depths of 410 km to 660 km. The New Zealand Auckland Volcanic Field is an example of this type of volcanic zone. The goal of this project is to image the melting region for these volcanos. This will be carried out by measuring the properties of the mantle beneath the North Island of New Zealand and the surrounding ocean using seismic waves from distant earthquakes recorded by seismometers on the ocean floor and on land. These results will be combined with numerical models and geochemical measurements to understand origins of these volcanic rocks. Broader impacts include support for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to develop a better global understanding of the processes that produce intraplate volcanism by resolving the origins of the Holocene Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF). The AVF is spatially separated from the subduction zone arc, and its magmas do not bear obvious contributions from subduction-related melting. Neither are these magmas clearly connected to a lower mantle plume, based on existing seismic tomography and helium isotopes. Rather, geochemical data raise the possibility that the AVF magmas provide a global end-member case of mantle melting that emanates from transition zone depths, a class of intraplate volcanism that has recently emerged. However, other processes such as melting driven by upwelling related to lithospheric instabilities and small-scale convection cannot be ruled out, and even upwelling from the lower mantle needs to be further evaluated. New seismic data will be collected from a temporary array of 20 US seafloor broadband seismometers (OBSs). These stations will be complemented by New Zealand-based land arrays, and an OBS deployment from SUSTech (China). With the proposed array, seismic analyses will test for the presence or absence of seismic velocity and attenuation anomalies, transition zone discontinuity topography, and seismic anisotropy associated with the competing hypotheses. US work will be integrated with seismological and volcanological analyses by New Zealand collaborators and a SUSTech geodynamical modeling effort. Results from this synthesis will provide estimates of the depth extent of melting, volatile ascent, and the degree to which this intraplate volcanism is driven by processes in the lithosphere, transition zone, or both. A range of critical questions will be addressed, including: What is the thermal structure from surface to transition-zone depths? Does upwelling occur, and from what depth, and are lithospheric instabilities present? What pathways do fluids and melt take as they ascend, and how do those pathways interact with large-scale flow? How does volcanism far behind the arc interact with the subduction system, if at all? This project will support graduate and undergraduate students at Cornell and Brown, including students from historically marginalized groups. Results from the project will be incorporated in the outreach and teaching activities of the PIs. The proposed project will enhance international collaborations. The project will provide a better understanding of the deep drivers for volcanic hazards, including young (<1 ka) volcanism within the Auckland urban area.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Marine Geology and Geophysics program in the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Geophysics program in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
99,Collaborative Research: SaTC: CORE: Medium: Securing Continuous Integration Workflows,"Continuous Integration (CI) has become essential to the modern software development cycle. Developers engineer CI scripts, commonly called workflows or pipelines, to automate most software maintenance tasks, such as testing and deployment. Developers frequently misconfigure workflows resulting in severe security issues, which can have devastating effects resulting in supply-chain attacks. The extreme diversity of CI platforms and the supported features further exacerbate the problem and make it challenging to specify and verify security properties across different CI platforms uniformly. This project addresses the problem by defining the desired security properties of a workflow and developing platform-independent techniques to verify and enforce the security properties. Furthermore, this research will support the cross-disciplinary development of a diverse cohort of Ph.D. and undergraduate students, graduate-level courses, and a gamified training environment for workflow security analysis.<br/><br/>This project defines the required security properties of CI workflows and develops methods to verify and specify these properties. This requires techniques that can work in a platform-independent manner to handle the diversity of CI platforms. The project handles this through indirection by designing Workflow Intermediate Representation (WIR) and Workflow Specification Language (WSL). WIR and WSL enable platform-agnostic verification and specification of workflow security properties, respectively. The verification of security properties will be performed through Workflow Analysis Framework (WAF) that supports both static and dynamic analysis passes over workflows encoded in a platform-agnostic WIR. WSL, a domain-specific language, allows developers to specify workflows and their security properties in a platform-independent manner. Designing an effective WSL requires understanding developers' perspectives and challenges in engineering workflows and specifying security properties. In this context, this project performs necessary developer studies to gain insights about the above aspects. The project also develops a bidirectional compilation infrastructure for translating workflows from WSL to platform-specific versions, enabling compatibility with existing platforms. Furthermore, the project also aims to create, collect, and catalog a large corpus of representative workflows across different platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
100,Computer-assisted Proofs in Fluid Mechanics and Applications,"The research goal of this project is twofold: on the one hand to pursue methods and ideas developed in recent work in the search for either singularities or global existence in incompressible fluids with finite energy and on the other to transfer the techniques to solve long-standing open problems in spectral geometry and mathematical physics. A key ingredient in its success is to have accurate numerics, together with a deep understanding of the regularity theory. Therefore, the interdisciplinary nature of the project, which involves numerical computations, physics informed neural networks (PINN), computer-assisted proofs, modern methods in partial differential equations (PDE) and harmonic analysis, is an essential ingredient for its successful outcome. The recent emergence of techniques blending mathematical analysis and deep learning offers a new opportunity for developing new angles of attack and better understanding classical problems in mathematics. Undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and research visitors actively participate in the work of this project.

101,AGEP FC-PAM: Alliance for Relevant and Inclusive Sponsorship of Engineering Researchers (ARISE) to Increase the Diversity of the Biomedical Engineering Faculty,"The AGEP Faculty Career Pathways Alliance Model (FC-PAM) “Alliance for Relevant and Inclusive Sponsorship of Engineers” (ARISE) promotes equity and inclusion in engineering higher education. The goal of the AGEP ARISE Alliance is to apply discipline-relevant, inclusive, and intersectional sponsorship and systemic change in hiring practices to increase the visibility, networks, collaborations, and professional success of Black and African American, Latine and Hispanic American, Native American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, and Native Pacific Islander biomedical engineering doctoral candidates, postdoctoral research scholars, and early career faculty members at Brown University, Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, and Yale University. This AGEP FC-PAM is building effective and professional sponsorship relationships outside the home institutions of the AGEP ARISE Alliance’s doctoral candidates, postdoctoral research scholars, and early career faculty members. Sponsorship is differentiated from mentorship as it is concerned less with the transfer of knowledge between individuals and more with the transfer of power through the promotion of the AGEP ARISE Alliance’s doctoral candidates, postdoctoral research scholars, and early career faculty members within professional networks. The doctoral candidates’, postdoctoral research scholars’, and early career faculty members’ intersecting identities around race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and caregiver status informs pairings with sponsors, who are participating in training on the importance of intersectionality in sponsorship. The AGEP ARISE Alliance is also adapting faculty hiring best practices from the University of Michigan’s ADVANCE program to both postdoctoral research scholar and early career faculty hiring policies and practices. <br/><br/>Improving equity and inclusion is critical to advancing STEM faculty members, educating America’s future STEM workforce, fostering individual opportunity, and contributing to a thriving U.S. economy. The NSF AGEP program, therefore, funds grants that advance and enhance the systemic factors that support equity and inclusion and, consequently, mitigate the systemic inequities in the academic profession and workplace. FC-PAM awards are intended to support the development, implementation, evaluation, and institutionalization of Alliance models that will advance AGEP populations, within similar institutions of higher education. FC-PAM collaborators also study how socio-cultural, economic, structural, leadership and institutional variables affect the formation of the FC-PAM, and the strategies or interventions the collaborators implement to advance AGEP populations.<br/><br/>The intermediate outcomes of the project are increases in the visibility, networks, opportunities, and collaborations of AGEP ARISE Alliance doctoral candidates, postdoctoral research scholars, and early career faculty members and improved cultural and diversity awareness among sponsors. Longer term these advances translate into more diverse faculty in the AGEP ARISE Alliance academic departments. Internal and external advisory boards routinely review the AGEP ARISE Alliance’s progress, strategize on future steps, and engage with sponsors and sponsees. An internal evaluator is leading the project’s self-study and formative assessment of implementation, changes in hiring practices, and changes in doctoral candidates’, postdoctoral research scholars’ and early career faculty members’ knowledge, aspirations, values, and professional activities resulting from Alliance activities. An external evaluator is providing summative assessment using a theory-based framework to assess the effectiveness of the AGEP ARISE Alliance in developing inclusive, nurturing networks of diverse doctoral candidates, postdoctoral research scholars, and early career faculty members in biomedical engineering; the ways those individuals have increased their visibility, networks, collaborations, and professional success; the impact of the project on fostering institutional climates that promote equity and inclusion; and the advancement of AGEP populations pursuing faculty positions in biomedical engineering. The AGEP ARISE Alliance team is developing and disseminating sponsorship and hiring guides, and project results, that are shared through peer-reviewed and general publications, an AGEP ARISE Alliance website, and presentations at scientific and professional meetings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
102,FRG: Collaborative Research: Singularities in Incompressible Flows: Computer Assisted Proofs and Physics-Informed Neural Networks,"Whether three-dimensional incompressible flows develop singularities in finite time and whether (weak) solutions of Navier-Stokes equations are unique, are two of the most important problems in mathematical fluid dynamics. Any progress towards resolving these problems would have significant implications for the entire field. This project integrates theoretical proofs, numerical analysis, and machine learning for understanding singularities in fluids. Our recent investigations demonstrate that intersection between mathematical proofs and deep learning offers an exciting avenue for understanding how singularity occurs in fluids. Together, the five PIs encompass strengths in several areas such as mathematical analysis, numerical simulation, or computer-assisted proofs. In addition, the project will foster collaborations and increased interactions between the researchers at several leading research universities in the US, utilizing tools developed in one field to advance another, and promote learning and training of students and postdoctoral researchers with a goal of broadening the participation of researchers from underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.<br/><br/>The PIs will focus on three specific projects: (1) non-uniqueness of the Leray-Hopf solutions of the Navier Stokes equations in 3 dimensions, (2) formation of singularities for solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations, and (3) optimization of physics-informed neural networks (PINN). Students, postdoctoral fellows, and visitors will be actively involved in these collaborations. To promote these exchanges research workshops will be organized once a year at the PIs’ institutions. These meetings will have two main objectives: a training objective, involving lectures to disseminate current ideas and progress; and an annual meeting of the PIs to review the progress and plan future steps. The PIs will also organize a summer school at Princeton University, aimed at graduate students and advanced undergraduate students. The summer school will have a scientific component, including minicourses on the mathematics of fluids, and a mentorship component, including a round table discussion regarding careers in mathematics and a women in mathematics panel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
103,"High Order Schemes: Bound Preserving, Moving Boundary, Stochastic Effects and Efficient Time Discretization","The project aims to develop efficient and high-precision numerical methods for solving partial differential equations in various important scientific and engineering applications, such as aerospace engineering, semiconductor device design, astrophysics, and biological applications. Even with today's fast supercomputers, it is still essential to design efficient and reliable algorithms to obtain accurate solutions to these applications where high precision can improve the safety and performance of those devices. These algorithms will make positive contributions to computer simulations of the complicated solution structure in these applications. The project will include workforce development for students from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>The project aims to investigate algorithm development, analysis, and application of high-order numerical methods, including discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element methods and finite difference and finite volume weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes. The algorithms will be designed to solve linear and nonlinear convection-dominated partial differential equations (PDEs), emphasizing bound preserving, moving boundary, stochastic effects and efficient time discretization. Topics of the research investigations will include an inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for numerical boundary conditions with moving boundaries and interfaces, mathematical properties and efficient solvers for forward-backward coupled PDE systems from traffic flow modeling, high order numerical methods for hysteretic flows, robust high order Lagrangian methods, efficient and stable time-stepping techniques for DG schemes and other spatial discretizations, high order accurate bound-preserving schemes and applications including problems involving highly nonlinear constraints and one step Lax-Wendroff type time discretizations, problems with stiff source terms, high order DG schemes for stationary hyperbolic equations and radiative transfer equations, oscillation-free DG methods, and numerical solutions of stochastic differential equations. The research will provide guidelines for the algorithms' applicability and limitations while enhancing their accuracy, stability, and robustness. The research will include collaborations with engineers and other applied scientists to enable the efficient application of these new algorithms or new features in existing algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
104,"The transition from normal subduction to slab window, unraveling its effect on the subcontinental lithospheric mantle of southern Patagonia","This team plans to evaluate the processes that create, modify and destroy the Earth’s continents. They will also estimate how changes in composition and mechanical properties of the continental roots affect its stability. This proposal focuses on Southern Patagonia, where the continental roots have been sampled by lavas erupted over the last 50 million years. Very recent seismological data also shows clear evidence of continental root removal. This research together with the new seismological observations will provide the necessary information to evaluate the evolution and stability of the Southern Patagonia continental root and how its removal might affect the composition of the nearby Earth’s interior. The results of this work will inform a similar ongoing study of the continental roots of West Antarctica. Combined, these projects have global implications for the stability of Patagonia and West Antarctica, which were once a single continent. The research team will collaborate nationally and internationally, and this project supports five analytical facilities in three US research institutions. The proposal supports an early-career researcher and a graduate and an undergraduate student at Brown University.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed work is to understand how subduction processes have affected the stability of the Southern Patagonia subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). This proposal aims to collect new geochemical and microstructural data on mantle xenoliths from across Southern Patagonia. The xenoliths have been sampled by erupted lavas over the last 50 million years; this time encompasses the tectonic transition from normal subduction of the Nazca oceanic plate to the formation of a slab window during the Chile Ridge-South America trench collision. The main objectives of this study are to determine the P-T conditions, extent of hydration, refertilization and deformation of the SCLM during this transition. It will allow estimation of the effective viscosity and stability of the lithospheric mantle and evaluation of whether the deformation occurred prior to or was affected by the introduction of water/melt. Furthermore, the proposed new data will be combined with new seismological observations to evaluate how these geologic processes affected the seismic properties (velocities, anisotropy) of the Southern Patagonia SCLM. Because the new seismological data show clear evidence of lithospheric mantle removal, the geochemical characterization of the mantle xenoliths will help test the hypothesis that the removed lithospheric mantle contributed to the composition of the volcanism not only in Southern Patagonia, but also in the Chile Ridge system. Finally, this proposal will be combined with an ongoing study of the lithospheric mantle of West Antarctica, which formed a single continental block with Southern Patagonia before the opening of the Drake passage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
105,Higher order methods for fluid structure interaction problems,"Multi-physics problems are ubiquitous in the real world and in engineering design. An important class of multi-physics problems are those of fluid-structure interactions (FSI) which involve an object governed by solid mechanics interacting with a fluid (e.g. a turbine interacting with the wind). Having reliable and efficient computer models for these problems are vital to understanding different natural physical systems and essential engineering problems. FSI problems are modeled mathematically by coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). Sophisticated numerical methods have been developed to approximate solutions of individual PDEs. However, the development of the state-of-the-art numerical methods for coupled PDEs remains a challenging task and continues to be a highly active and dynamic area of research. Training of at least one graduate student on the topics of the project is expected.<br/><br/>As part of this effort, the development of provably stable higher-order splitting methods for FSI problems will be pursued. Splitting methods take advantage of fine-tuned numerical methods for fluid problems and solid problems. One solves each problem separately and they communicate via boundary conditions. The challenge is to make the methods both stable and higher-order accurate. Indeed, most of the numerical methods that are provably stable are low order accurate in time. The PI will build on the work done with collaborators using Robin-Robin methods. The Robin-Robin methods previously developed will be used as a base method for a more sophisticated correction method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
106,DDRIG in DRMS: The implications of algorithmic decision-making for inequality in long-term care,"States are increasingly using algorithms to determine eligibility for Medicaid-funded long-term healthcare for elderly people and people with disabilities in the United States. As opposed to Medicaid more generally, eligibility for long-term care is based on functional capacity and disability status in addition to income and assets. Previously, states may have relied solely on physicians to decide whether a long-term care applicant is functionally eligible, but many states now use algorithms to make this determination. Though algorithms are often purported to be less biased than humans, research has shown that algorithms often increase inequality, especially inequality between demographic categories. However, the population-level consequences of algorithmic decision-making for inequality are still unclear. Medicaid long-term care is an important case to address this evidence gap; Medicaid is a crucial source of healthcare for millions of Americans, especially for members of marginalized groups. Additionally, the number of people who require long-term care will likely increase as the elderly population grows over the next few decades, making this issue particularly timely. This research sheds light on how algorithmic decision-making, and which characteristics of algorithms, are better or worse for equity in access to long-term care.<br/><br/>This dissertation uses mixed methods to answer three primary research questions: 1) How and why do state Medicaid programs use algorithms in long-term care eligibility determination? 2) How do Medicaid bureaucrats use algorithms to perform long-term care eligibility assessments? 3) What is the relationship between algorithm implementation and inequality between demographic categories in long-term care access? By linking Medicaid claims data with primary data on the algorithms used by each state, this project estimates how algorithm implementation is associated with inequality in long-term care (RQ3). In-depth interviews with Medicaid administrators in three states elucidate the mechanisms underlying this relationship (RQ1 and RQ2). Results help identify organization-level social determinants of health that can potentially be altered to improve equity. Further, the primary data collected to answer RQ3 will be made publicly available to enable future research on algorithms in long-term care and give Medicaid long-term care beneficiaries better insight into how their benefits are determined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
107,Measure Transportation And Notions Of Dimensionality In High Dimensional Probability,"High dimensional probability is a mathematical theory which aims to explain the behavior of systems with very large number of degrees of freedom. Such systems are of utmost importance in the physical sciences and in a world where social media and communication networks constantly generate huge data sets. This project aims to develop theoretical tools in high dimensional probability via two methods. The first method will exploit the intuition that in many practical situations, although the system contains numerous degrees of freedom, the relevant information is contained in a much smaller set of variables. The project will aim to quantify this intuition by developing the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. The second method aims to represent a given complex system as the transformation of a much simpler system. The project also includes educational efforts, including mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and the dissemination of the work in professional meetings and to the public. <br/><br/>The long-term goal is to improve understanding of high-dimensional probability measures via two approaches. The first approach is to develop an original concept of intrinsic dimensionality in the context of functional inequalities. The notion of dimension plays a crucial role in functional inequalities via the curvature-dimension condition, but it ignores the fact that the measures of interest can live on lower-dimensional spaces. This omission can lead to inefficient functional inequalities; this project hopes to bridge this gap. The second approach is to develop new measure transportation methods based on stochastic processes and probabilistic flows. For example, Lipschitz transport maps provide a powerful way to transfer functional inequalities from simple source measures to complicated target measures. Only a few such Lipschitz transport maps are known to exist, which limits the applicability of the transport method. The project will utilize the tools of stochastic analysis and renormalization group methods to build transport maps with desirable regularity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
108,"Collaborative Research: Integrated Experiments and Modeling for Spatial, Finite, and Fast Rheometry of Graded Hydrogels using Inertial Cavitation","Until recently, inertial cavitation—the rapid, unstable growth and collapse of bubbles—has been best known as a damaging agent in environments such as pumps, coatings, and bodily tissues. Current advances in medicine aim to harness inertial cavitation to cut tissues noninvasively using ultrasound, but this goal is limited by available data. A present challenge is that tissues and various soft material systems are complex, with interfaces and stiffness gradients along different internal directions. This award supports characterizing, modeling, and predicting the mechanical response of non-uniform soft materials subject to rapid bubble collapse and oscillation. This knowledge could be used, for example, to speed up assessment during ultrasound-based surgery and provide critical insight into mitigating injury from rapid forces. Thus, the research will not only promote the progress of science but will also advance national health, prosperity, and welfare. This project will further train students working across disciplines of fluid and solid mechanics, and materials science. The team will encourage scientific learning in a broad early-learner audience via the development of two children's books written in multiple languages and outreach activities about soft material mechanics.<br/><br/>A single test probing ultra-high-rate and finite deformation regimes of materials simultaneously has been elusive. Prior work has established inertial cavitation rheometry as a promising candidate, but the technique restrictively assumes spherical symmetry. This project aims to leverage quantities surrounding asphericity—regarded as a problem in the original technique—as a critical metric for assessing local material gradients. A multi-perspective, ultra-high-rate microscopy platform for characterizing graded, ultraviolet-light-tunable hydrogels using bubble kinematics, and full-field deformations determined via embedded speckle plane-based digital image correlation comprise the experimental setup. Concurrently, numerical methods leveraging (a) full-field kinematic fields with simulation and (b) bubble shape perturbation information with a modified 1D-perturbation model of the governing equations of motion and conservation will establish a suite of baseline problems. Together, critical measurable quantities in the inverse calibration problem will be used to establish a fast reduced-order model for describing both material behavior and gradients therein. This approach will provide a methodology for producing linearly graded hydrogels, a database of ultra-high-rate, finite viscoelastic hydrogel behavior, upgraded inverse-calibration procedures leveraging spherical perturbations and simulations, and a reduced-order approach for fast rheology without, with, or with-coupled property gradients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
109,"CAREER: Countering Emerging Software Threats with Adaptive Hardening, Debloating, and Hardware-assisted Protection","Today's large and complex software systems are plagued with vulnerabilities that allow perpetrators to exploit it for profit. Of all the different kinds of exploitable software weaknesses, memory errors -- i.e., bugs that can be (ab)used by attackers, via crafty inputs, to corrupt or leak memory contents -- have been particularly pernicious to deal with. Developers and security engineers are unable to keep up with the sheer number of security errors (e.g., memory errors) being exploited that need patching. The focus of this project is on adapting software defenses to the specific deployment environment, as that environment changes due to new functionality and new threats. The project will produce open source prototypes of tools to automate the adaptation of defenses, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the defenses while radically reducing the human effort involved in defending against new threats as they arise. The objective is to enable more effective, sophisticated defenses by automating the customization of defenses to fit the deployment environments. The resulting techniques and tools will contribute to the next-generation security architecture that enables software defenses to be constantly in flux to provide robust software protection mechanisms. <br/><br/>The project consists of three synergistic thrusts under the umbrella of adaptive security: adaptive hardening, hardware-assisted adaptive protection and adaptive debloating. The project will investigate techniques to enable software systems to dynamically adapt their defenses and functionality along several dimensions. Techniques for binary rewriting and program hardening will be enhanced to support adaptability. Adaptive hardening will equip binaries with rich metadata including call graphs and types. Static binary rewriting performs install-time, load-time, and runtime adaptations. Hardware-assisted adaptive hardening uses hardware features such as Intel's CET for adaptive hardening; Finally, unused code is removed by automating debloating. There are several benefits of an adaptive approach to software security. First, the capability to be agile in software hardening creates a diversified and unpredictable environment, which hinders the ability of adversaries to use canned recipes to bypass exploit mitigations. Second, hardening rectification allows software to make the best use of the hardening capabilities that a particular setting offers, while dynamically adapting the deployed defenses to meet changing needs. The outcomes of this research will improve the state-of-the-art in defense against emerging software threats, and alleviate the concerns of the broader security community regarding hurdles (e.g., performance, compatibility) that until now have prevented the deployment of protections with guaranteed security properties. The project will develop and share new knowledge through cybersecurity and computer science curricula, and more broadly thought workshops and seminars for high school students and science educators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
110,Collaborative Research: SaTC: CORE: Medium: Cryptographic accumulators and revocation of credentials,"As we increasingly conduct so much of our daily lives online, user authentication becomes a vital part for numerous everyday tasks such as shopping, banking and communicating. A common mechanism for digital authentication is the use of authentication tokens, credentials or certificates. Extra care needs to be taken, however, when authentication tokens are compromised, lost or held by an owner who goes rogue. In such cases, it is crucial that there exist an effective mechanism to securely and efficiently revoke such tokens. The goal of this project is to design efficient revocation mechanisms for the Web Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and potentially transform the future of certificate revocation on the web and beyond; our key innovation is the use of cryptographic accumulators.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on deploying cryptographic accumulators to improve practicality and reach of revocation mechanisms for Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates in the Web PKI. Beyond TLS, the project will also concern itself with revocation in code-signing PKI by deploying batching and aggregation techniques on cryptographic accumulators for efficient software validity checks. Finally, the project will address privacy issues when checking revocation and will design solutions that can safeguard the privacy of users in Internet-of-Things (IoT) connected communities. The project vision also includes constructions that satisfy post-quantum security. The intellectual merits of this project are twofold: First, it will provide numerous results on fundamental cryptographic building blocks, such as cryptographic accumulators and (zero-knowledge) proof batch computation/verification and aggregation. The results of this part, while tailored to serve the functionality needs of revocation systems, can be of much broader interest (e.g., also apply in the areas of blockchain scalability, secure computation on the cloud, etc.). Then, this project will also have a strong implementation and evaluation component. All proposed protocols will be implemented, evaluated and compared with existing techniques. The prototype implementations will be integrated in real systems to test how the proposed accumulator protocols perform in real-world settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
111,Electron Densities and Electron Correlations by X-Ray Scattering,"With support from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Peter M. Weber of Brown University is using x-ray scattering techniques to observe how electrons orbit the atomic nuclei of molecules. Electron orbitals are the places where electrons are preferentially located and have distinct shapes that depend upon the arrangement of the nuclei and the electron energy. In molecules with more than one electron, repulsions between the electrons affect the orbital shape. In short, the motion of an electron depends upon the motion of all the other electrons, giving rise to correlations in electron motion that profoundly affect all molecular properties. For example, when molecules absorb light, an electron is promoted to a higher energy state and the distributions and correlations change, resulting in a multitude of photochemical phenomena. Observing these changes are difficult though, given the speed with which electrons move. Professor Weber and his students will use time-resolved x-ray scattering methods to measure precise excited state molecular structures, electron density distributions and electron-electron pair correlations that are central to molecular properties. Their discoveries could lead to new benchmarks that aid the continued development of quantum chemistry computer programs. Since quantum chemistry calculations are used throughout the molecular sciences, the project could have far-reaching ramifications and impact in many related fields. The project will train students in advanced experimental methodologies and complex computer simulations.<br/><br/>Time-resolved X-ray scattering experiments will be conducted at the Linac Coherent Light Source X-Ray Free Electron Laser of SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. Femtosecond laser pulses will be used to excite molecules to excited electronic states. After a short time-delay, an ultrashort x-ray pulse from the free electron laser is scattered off the molecules. The measured scattering signals are compared to theoretical ones derived from computed electron density distributions and correlations. The project will extend the x-ray methods used to determine molecular structures and electron densities of ground states to the excited state and include electron-electron correlations. The studies will focus on a selection of model systems with different p-electron characters and electron correlations. Codes for simulating scattering patterns directly from computational methods and an iterative refinement process have been developed and will be applied. The experimentally measured densities, correlations and structures are compared to the results of high-level computational chemistry methods and serve as benchmarks for the quantum chemistry calculations. The studies will improve our understanding of molecular structures and chemical reactivity, which in turn determines many chemical and material properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
112,"REU Site: Dynamic Earth in the 21st Century: Undergraduate Research on the Evolution of Earth's Interior, Surface and Climate","Dynamic Earth in the 21st Century is a National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site that is collaboratively run by Brown University’s Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS) and the Leadership Alliance. The primary goals are to enable undergraduates from groups historically marginalized in the sciences to engage in exciting, well-mentored summer research experiences; develop key research and professional skills; and build their understanding of the research process, graduate school and research careers. In each of three summers, eight undergraduates who attend schools other than Brown University will come to Brown’s campus for nine weeks of research, mentored by DEEPS faculty. REU students will be further supported by research lab teams, a twice-weekly cohort discussion group, and the highly effective professional development and networking programs of the Leadership Alliance, a national consortium dedicated to training and mentoring students from diverse cultural and academic backgrounds for competitive graduate programs and professional research-based careers. REU students will enhance their abilities to communicate their work in writing and through presentations at the Leadership Alliance National Symposium and a summer research symposium at Brown. In the following year, the REU students will have the opportunity to present their work at a national science meeting that aligns with their interests. <br/><br/>REU student research projects will span a range of research themes, including: 1) Measuring mantle properties with earthquake waves, and modeling how mantle viscosity affects predictions of sea-level change in response to melting ice sheets; 2) Assessing the role of subduction zones in recycling water into Earth’s mantle; 3) Understanding the processes that contribute to volcanic eruptions and magma chamber stability, and modeling the formation of volcanic edifices on Earth and other planetary bodies; 4) Developing new tools to measure rock thermal histories; 5) Measuring the record of past climate change in lake and ocean sediments, and assessing glacial re-advances with sediment deformation structures; 6) Modeling the feedbacks between climate change and vegetation; 7) Assessing the drivers of air and water quality with a focus on urban landscapes. These projects include implications for societally-relevant topics such as climate change and its impacts including sea-level rise, wildfires, and vegetation responses; air and water quality; and volcanic eruptions. Recruitment will focus on students from historically marginalized groups or who face other barriers to participation in the geosciences: students from racial and ethnic groups underrepresented in STEM, women and non-binary students, first-generation college students, students from lower income households, students who attend schools where geoscience research opportunities are limited, and students with disabilities. The program welcomes students of all sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions, and students from diverse life experiences and academic paths, including veterans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
113,Comprehensive analysis of alkenones and alkenoates by reversed phase HPLC-MS with unprecedented sensitivity and selectivity,"This project will develop sensitive and time-saving analytical methods to quantify an important class of organic compounds, long chain alkenones, in ocean and lake environments. Alkenones are produced only by microalgae belonging to the order Isochrysidales, with no other organisms known to make such compounds. Such unique compounds are termed biomarkers. Alkenone biomarkers are extremely resistant to break-down and have been found in geological sediments as old as 120 million years. Remarkably, alkenones measured from ocean and lake environments display consistent structural changes at different growth temperatures and also track aquatic photosynthetic productivity. Thus, measurement of alkenones in ancient sediments provides quantitative insights to past climate and aquatic productivity. That information helps predict future changes in climate and aquatic ecosystems in the era of global warming induced by human activities. The project Broader Impacts include support for a Ph.D. graduate student, undergraduate student researchers, and a high school summer intern. <br/><br/>Traditionally, alkenones are analyzed using gas chromatograph coupled to a flame ionization detector (GCFID), or in extremely low concentration samples, gas chromatograph-chemical ionization mass spectrometry (GCCIMS). However, GCFID is non-selective (i.e., cannot exclude interferences if present) and has relatively low sensitivity and requires tedious sample cleanup for complex samples, whereas GCCIMS displays non-linear and often variable responses to alkenones, which increases analytical uncertainties. The proposed research takes advantage of the latest advances in high pressure liquid chromatograph mass spectrometry (HPLCMS). Preliminary data shows that the new reversed phase HPLC-MS based analytical methods will have much higher sensitivity (up to two orders of magnitudes), and exceptional selectivity (i.e., strong capability to exclude interferences) for analyzing alkenones. The proposed work includes testing various liquid chromatographic conditions (solvent elution schemes, column types) to optimize the chromatographic separation of long chain alkenones. Mass spectrometry parameters including two different ionization modes (atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, or electrospray ionization), and various electronic settings will also be optimized. A series of algal culture samples will be grown at different temperatures and measured using the traditional GCFID method. These culture samples will then be used as standards for calibration between the authentic alkenone proxy values and HPLCMS based measurements. A large set of global ocean surface sediments collected from diverse ocean environments and containing variable interferences will be analyzed to fully validate the new reversed phase HPLCMS methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
114,SHF: Small: Little Tricky Logics: Misconceptions in Understanding Logics and Formal Properties,"Formal logics are widely employed in computer science to precisely state a user's intent. These can be used in many different ways: an existing system can be checked to conform to these statements, or a fresh system can even be generated that obeys these intentions. However, humans often have various misconceptions about these logics, which taints any subsequent use of them: if the logical statement means something other than what the human intends, then it is not merely useless, it is actively misleading. The project's novelties are to elucidate these misconceptions and to evaluate methods to correct them. The project's impacts are in aiding education, in the creation of tools to help authors, and also in the design of new formal logics.<br/><br/>Concretely, the project aims to investigate misconceptions in three formal settings: Linear Temporal Logic, the Alloy language (a first-order logic with transitive closure), and in basic structural properties used widely in formal specification (such as transitivity). The project uses a variety of methods to elicit misconceptions, taking into account the need to overcome expert blind spots. The project also employs techniques from the existing misconception literature to overcome the problems that it finds. The resulting study instruments and techniques to address misconceptions would be immediately useful in many settings, and the general flow of the work would be broadly applicable to others who wish to reproduce it for their preferred logics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
115,AF: Small: Faster Algorithms for High-Dimensional Robust Statistics,"As machine learning plays a more prominent role in our society, there is a need for learning algorithms that are reliable and robust. In modern machine learning, one often needs to work with data that are high-dimensional and noisy. Recent work gave the first efficient robust estimators for several basic statistical problems, and since then, there has been a flurry of research that obtained efficient robust algorithms for many machine-learning problems. However, one major drawback of existing algorithms in the literature is that they tend to be much slower when compared to their non-robust counterparts, or they often involve parameters that require careful tuning. To address these issues, this project aims to (i) design faster and provably robust algorithms for a wide range of high-dimensional statistical and learning tasks, and (ii) explore non-convex formulations of robust estimation and analyze their optimization landscape. This project will advance the fields of computer science and statistics, and also potentially lead to useful tools for other areas. The pursuit of faster and simpler algorithms will help accelerate technology transfer into practice, stimulate systematic approaches to robustness, and provide a positive societal impact in the long run. The education plan of this project includes incorporating the materials generated from this project into graduate-level courses at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), as well as training graduate and undergraduate students at UIC, which is an urban university with a diverse student population.<br/><br/>Designing robust algorithms in high dimensions is a very challenging task. Even for the basic problem of mean estimation, when a small fraction of the input is adversarially corrupted, no efficient algorithms were known until recently. The first polynomial-time estimators with dimension-independent error guarantees were discovered in 2016. However, given the amount of data available today, polynomial-time no longer translates to scalability in practice. Motivated by the need for faster and more practical algorithms, this project focuses on two main thrusts to expand the area of algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics. First, the investigator would like to speed up existing algorithms and develop new robust algorithms for a broader range of problems and richer families of distributions, with the ultimate goal of matching the runtime of the fastest non-robust algorithms. Second, the investigator wants to design robust estimators that can be computed via standard first-order optimization methods. The main challenge is to find an objective function whose gradient can be evaluated using basic matrix operations while proving the structural result that this objective has no bad local optima. Concretely, the investigator plans to work on these two thrusts by targeting various aspects of the following problems: (1) robust stochastic optimization, (2) robust sparse mean estimation and sparse PCA, (3) robust covariance estimation, (4) list-decodable learning, and (5) robust learning of Bayesian networks. This project is interdisciplinary and will rely on intuition and techniques from statistics, probability, linear algebra, discrete and continuous optimization, and non-convex optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
116,"Collaborative Research: Towards a new framework for interpreting mantle deformation: integrating theory, experiments, and observations spanning seismic to convective timescales","The Earth’s mantle, which sits directly below the crust, is predominantly made of solid rock; yet the solid mantle can flow when pushed or pulled. The rate of this flow depends on the properties of the rock, such as its temperature, and on the nature of the contacts between the tiny mineral crystals that comprise the rock. The mantle can be pushed to flow by numerous different phenomena, such as: passing seismic waves after an earthquake; melting of continental ice sheets and glaciers; the annual cycle of groundwater recharge and extraction; and the draining of large lakes. This study uses observations of these phenomena to measure the rock properties and the interactions between mineral crystals in the mantle beneath three locations: the western United States, Alaska, and Iceland. Meanwhile, laboratory experiments are probing how samples of rock deform under controlled conditions. Finally, new computer models are synthesizing the lab and field observations to understand the underlying physical laws that explain the full suite of data. The results of this study have a bearing on topics that range from predicting how sea level will rise due to melting ice sheets to understanding tidal deformation on Jupiter’s moons. Outreach and training are key elements of the project. Four graduate students and six undergraduate students are being educated over the duration of the project. Workshops will bring together researchers from diverse scientific disciplines to learn and debate about the scientific outcomes and the computer tools developed as part of this study.<br/><br/>There is emerging recognition that the variables describing Earth’s mechanical response to stress, elastic moduli, attenuation, and viscosity, are all frequency dependent. While the end-member elastic and steady-state behaviors are relatively well understood, there remain many fundamental questions regarding the intermediate transient regime. This study is an integrative research and outreach program that combines observational, laboratory, and modeling efforts to measure Earth’s full-spectrum rheological response and illuminate the underlying microphysical processes. Observational work is characterizing frequency dependent upper-mantle dissipation in three locations (western U.S., Iceland, and Alaska) using seismic and geodetic observations of different frequencies but complementary spatial sampling. Experimental work is investigating how dislocations affect transient creep under different temperature and stress conditions and with variable quantities of melt and secondary solid phases. Modeling work is developing new constitutive laws for transient creep and incorporating more sophisticated rheologies in the viscoelastic deformation code. This study is addressing questions about: (1) the broadband mechanical response of the solid Earth; (2) the microphysical processes that control viscoelasticity; and (3) the implications for inferences of steady-state viscosity from geodetic observations and of thermodynamic state from seismic tomography. Broader impacts include training of graduate and undergraduate students, a synthesis workshop that convenes 120 researchers to outline recent advances in understanding transient rheology and to shape the topics and collaborations that will dictate the next decade of inquiry, and development of interactive Jupyter notebooks that introduce open-source data-science tools in the context of seismic attenuation and transient rheology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
117,"Collaborative Research: BoCP-Implementation: The impact of climate change on functional biodiversity across spatiotemporal scales at Lake Tanganyika, Africa","Lake Tanganyika is renowned for its biodiversity, but the spectacular life in this vast and ancient ecosystem is threatened by warming temperatures in ways that are not well-understood. As one of sub-Saharan Africa’s most prolific inland fisheries, a healthy Lake Tanganyika is critically important to the nutrition of four developing nations. If global warming alters internal processes that affect the fish production in Lake Tanganyika, then the food security for millions of people will suffer. Moreover, the impacts of climate change on the characteristics of different groups making up Lake Tanganyika’s open water and lake floor communities, as well as interactions among these groups, are unknown. This project aims to study the response of Lake Tanganyika’s food web to several different scenarios of climate change using sediments, fossils, and genetic tools. The results of the project will reveal how aquatic organisms, particularly economically valuable fish, respond to changes in temperature and precipitation within large tropical lakes. With this information, fisheries and ecosystem managers will be better equipped to safeguard food resources and biodiversity in their areas of responsibility. Finally, this project will include strong international partnership to train students, conduct workshops and develop materials for public audiences.<br/><br/>This project will use Lake Tanganyika’s high-resolution sedimentary record to set up a series of historical experiments to track functional biodiversity lake-wide. This framework integrates geochemical, fossil, and genomic tools to assess open water and bottom-dwelling community structures and functions under different scenarios of climate change, as well as the physical and physiological responses of key organisms to these changes. Because the hydroclimatic conditions of the Holocene are underrepresented in historical data, this approach provides the opportunity to evaluate the consequences of environmental change for Lake Tanganyika’s food web in a way that was previously impossible to know. In addition, the project will identify shared and divergent responses to climatic fluctuations across the lake’s diverse fauna, and link these responses to trait-based understanding of community assembly and functioning. This work holds potential for predicting changes in biodiversity amidst severe climatic uncertainty in large tropical lakes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
118,Collaborative Research: SaTC: CORE: Small: Expanding the Realm of Oblivious Transfer: New Tools for Cryptography,"Nowadays, vast amounts of individual information are collected by numerous entities for providing a variety of services. Due to the sensitive nature of the collected data, the need for developing techniques and tools that enable privacy-preserving computation on big data is more necessary than ever. This project aims to enhance the functionality, security, and efficiency of oblivious transfer (OT), a fundamental primitive in cryptography, with a broader goal of improving the efficiency and usability of cryptographic systems in both theory and practice, especially in the era of big data. The project's novelties are developing tools that play an integral role in the design of privacy-preserving protocols. Such protocols have societal benefits, enabling computation on sensitive data while keeping the data private. The project's impacts include achieving more efficient protocols for many important real-world applications and deepening our understanding of efficient constructions and fundamental limits in many areas in cryptography that are related to OT, such as secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs, advanced types of encryption and more. The investigators integrate their research results into curricula for both undergraduate and graduate level courses and are committed to mentoring and advising students at all levels, from undergraduate to PhD, especially those from under-represented groups in computing.<br/><br/>The project focuses on three main thrusts to expand the realm of oblivious transfer. First, the investigators design efficient constructions of OT with advanced functionality and strengthened security, which can be better leveraged in cryptographic systems. These OT notions provide features for reducing communication and computation costs in various settings, making them indispensable tools in big-data applications. Second, the project investigates a specific MPC problem that has close connections to OT. In particular, using advanced OT tools, the investigators improve the efficiency and enrich the functionality of private set intersection (PSI) protocols, which have wide applications in practice. Finally, the project identifies and formalizes barriers that may exist against the above goals; this is carried out by proving lower bounds on the assumption complexity or efficiency of constructions for the above goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
119,Collaborative Research: Electromagnet-integrated optical microscope stage with biocompatible magnetogel for investigating mechanobiology in 2D and 3D,"An award is made to the University of Southern California in collaboration with Brown University (2222207) to develop an instrument that can be used to investigate how mechanical forces can control or influence biological systems. Through the research activities, we will train undergraduate students, PhD students, and post-doctoral scholars. Notably, by launching a collaboration with the newly started NSF Advanced Technological Education Center located at Pasadena City College, we will host two undergraduate community college students, directly incorporating undergraduates into the research activities. These students will be mentored by the PhD students and post-doctoral scholar who will be involved in this research effort. We will disseminate the findings through freely accessible online repositories such as the NIH 3D Print Exchange and GitHub and through scholarly publications and conference presentations. To increase the scientific literacy of the general public, we will leverage social media for broader dissemination of the research findings and scientific life.<br/><br/>It is well-established that chemical exposure can modify a biological system, changing the behavior of cells and tissue. Evidence is emerging that physical forces can play a similar role, and in some cases, these physical effects can combine with chemical stimuli to amplify or to eliminate a biological response. Changes in the mechanical properties of surfaces in contact with cells and tissues also modulate biological activity. Therefore, it is critical to understand the role of mechanical forces in biological processes. However, only a few tools can accurately study this complex behavior in limited settings. This award will support the development and validation of a more broadly applicable instrument that will overcome this cross-cutting hurdle. The technology will be compatible with a standard fluorescence microscope, enabling simultaneous imaging and manipulation of the physical properties of the biological system. To accomplish this goal, two new synergistic technologies will be developed. To demonstrate relevance to current and future NSF BIO Directorate programs, a pair of proof-of-concept measurements in neuroscience and in bacterial research will be performed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
120,"Collaborative Research: CNS Core: Medium: Access, Mobility, and Security above 100 GHz","The use of frequencies above 100 GHz for wireless communication is rapidly emerging as a key enabler for future (beyond 5G) wireless systems. These high-frequency systems, which are referred to as terahertz (THz) links, offer numerous exciting possibilities, such as ultra-high-speed data transmission and enhanced resilience against malicious attacks such as eavesdropping. Yet, so far, little research has been devoted to the question of how to implement a network that can provide high bandwidth links for multiple mobile users, while still maintaining security against eavesdroppers. The objective of this proposal is to develop the hardware and protocols necessary to implement a secure network for mobile users which efficiently exploits these high frequencies. The research team will develop a set of methodologies to enable a base station to rapidly locate multiple users in a broadcast region (even if they are moving), to establish high-speed wireless links with each of them, and to detect and mitigate eavesdropping attacks. In addition, the project includes a coordinated plan for broadening participation of traditionally<br/>under-represented groups, and includes a one-week summer course on THz research for high-school students.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop a radically new node architecture which can intrinsically support multiple access for mobile clients in a broadband THz network, while also maintaining a high degree of security. One thrust of this project involves the exploration of novel antenna designs which exploit strong angular dispersion. We propose a new method to enable active fast electrical tuning of such devices which will be exploited for detection of an eavesdropping attack, as well as for localization of legitimate users and mobility detection. A second project thrust aims to develop spatio-temporal modulated array architectures for scrambling the information contained in side-lobes of the broadcast, via spectral aliasing. Combined with agile sensing functionalities, the proposed interface will selectively create secure zones for communication. In a third thrust, we will leverage the power of this new node architecture to ensure that the quality of service for multiple mobile users is maintained, even while guaranteeing that eavesdroppers are unable to access, not only the primary communication channels, but also control plane functions required to establish and maintain mobile links. The result will provide the optimal performance for a spectrally efficient and secure THz network, even in the presence of a sophisticated attack by colluding eavesdroppers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
121,Transport Dynamics of the Northeast Pacific  In a Changing Climate,"Over the last decades, the Northeast Pacific (NEP), has experienced dramatic changes in its climate with the occurrence of a sequence of record-breaking temperature extremes between 2013-2019, such as the multi-year 2013-15 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave, the strong 2015-16 El Niño, and more recently the ongoing 2019 Alaskan heatwave. The resulting changes in temperature and eddy-scale ocean transport dynamics (e.g. cross-shore, alongshore, upwelling) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and California Current System (CCS) led to dramatic ecosystem impacts that include harmful algal blooms along the coasts, low primary productivity, massive die offs of mammals and birds. Despite advances in our understanding of the large-scale Pacific changes, it remains unclear how regional transport dynamics of the GOA and CCS are responding to the observed climate extremes and trends in decadal climate variability in the NEP, and what changes in transport statistics are expected under anthropogenic climate forcing. Key Questions: (Q1) How did the amplification of the regional climate variance in the Northeast Pacific over the last decades impact eddy-scale transport dynamics (e.g. alongshore, cross-shore, upwelling) in the California and Gulf of Alaska circulation systems? (Q2) What are the Pacific largescale drivers that control the regional ocean transport statistics during the recent temperature extremes (2013-2019), and are the changes in transport significant (e.g. an extreme) in the context of historical long-term variability (1950-2000)? (Q3) How are ecologically-relevant transport statistics in the Northeast Pacific expected to change under anthropogenic forcing (2050-2100), and are these changes consistent with what occurred during the recent extremes (2013-2019)? The goal of this research is to identify and estimate the response of ecologically-relevant eddyscale transport dynamics in the Northeast Pacific to (GOAL1) recent amplifications of large-scale climate forcing (e.g. extremes, trends, decadal variability), and (GOAL2) projected changes in anthropogenic climate change as inferred from large-ensemble of individual Earth System Models (ESMs) that allow to separate the internal vs forced variability. Two female Ph.D. students will be trained and mentored. The PI will share this research in his ongoing interdisciplinary research/leadership activities in the California-LTER, PICES, and US CLIVAR. The high-resolution regional climate ensemble archive generated in this study will be a unique asset to the marine research community in the Northeast Pacific. The PI will work with the CCE-LTER team to make the model output available for interdisciplinary studies and to develop a set of Linear Inverse Model tutorials to help marine ecosystem scientists apply this methodology to explore ecological dynamics.<br/><br/>The approaches & TASKs of the investigation will include (T1) a 10-member ensemble of high-resolution regional coupled ocean-atmosphere model historical simulations of the Northeast Pacific (1950-2019) with a passive tracers transport module to downscale the impact of large-scale Pacific climate forcing on regional transport dynamics in the GOA and CCS, (T2) a set of Linear Inverse Models (LIMs) to identify and quantify the effects of large-scale drivers on ecologically-relevant regional transport statistics inferred from the passive tracers, (T3) the use of large ensemble simulations of individual ESMs (e.g. CESM, GFDL ESM2M) under the SSP5-8.5 or equivalent scenario as input to the LIM to investigate how anthropogenic forcing is projected to impact the targeted transport statistics in the context of internal climate variability. The recent increase in climate variance and ecosystem synchrony in the Northeast Pacific, together with the ecological and societal impacts of the temperatures extremes of the 2013-15 Northeast Pacific marine heatwave, the strong 2015-16 El Niño, 2019 Alaskan heatwave, raise concern and questions of the role of natural and anthropogenic forcing in the regional oceanography of the Northeast Pacific. Eddy-scale transport dynamics (e.g. alongshore, cross-shore, upwelling) have long been recognized as a key driver of marine ecosystem change, yet the response of these dynamics to a changing climate remains unclear. This work will provide understanding on how the recent trends in the climate variance of ecological drivers relates to long-term historical variability and to anthropogenic forcing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
122,Equipment: Helium Recovery Equipment: Securing Rhode Island and Southern New England NMR structural biology infrastructure,"An award is made to Brown University to support the acquisition of helium recovery equipment to recycle the helium used by the three nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers in the Structural Biology Core Facility at Brown University. Used by researchers at Brown, in Rhode Island, and across southeastern New England, the NMR spectrometers at Brown University employ extremely high magnetic fields to see the structure, motions, and interactions of proteins and biomolecules involved in essential biological processes with atomic resolution. The Brown structural biology facility is also an important component of efforts by researchers in the region to make broad and sustained educational impacts, encouraging underserved Rhode Island school students into the STEM pipeline – including classroom teaching, training of students from groups under-represented in science, and collecting data and serving as training platform as part of a sustained interactions with local underserved public schools. These NMR spectrometers use superconducting magnets cooled by liquid helium to a few degrees above absolute zero to maintain superconductivity needed for these high magnetic fields. As a result, helium constantly boils off NMR systems and escapes to the atmosphere. Hence, a constant supply of helium is needed for the maintenance and operation of the instruments. Helium is an expensive and non-renewable resource, so it is fiscally and environmentally responsible to recycle helium. The global supply of helium is currently in an extreme shortage due to manufacturing and supply chain conditions. The liquid helium recycling systems acquired with support from this award will capture and re-liquefy the helium released from NMR spectrometers and offer high efficiency recovery of all helium used for NMR operation. <br/><br/>The project enables acquisition of the helium liquification and collection equipment necessary for recycling approximately 2200 liters of liquid helium per year for three magnet systems. The 850 MHz NMR (highest magnetic field in Rhode Island and second highest in New England) requires refills every few weeks – hence the facility is severely endangered by short-term supply outages. This project stabilizes helium supply, providing the important added benefit of lengthening time between 850 MHz system fills, enabling more usage time per year. The work enabled by the spectrometers served by these helium recovery efforts provides atomic-level insight into 1) the function of essential glutamine-rich domains of nucleic-acid interacting proteins across all eukaryotes and the mechanisms that regulate their interactions, 2) allosteric signaling in Cas9 to yield first-of-its-kind insight into DNA editing to further improve laboratory science and precision medicine, 3) peptide-protein interaction kinetics to modulate and study cellular networks, among other projects. Helium recycling ensures the ability to continue these efforts, the first steps in long-term objectives to map mechanistic links between biological sequence, structure and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
123,Collaborative Research: SWIFT-SAT: RFI Detection Across Six Orders of Magnitude in Intensity: A Unifying Framework with Weakly Supervised Machine Learning,"The coexistence of satellite constellations with ground-based astronomy is a growing challenge with the increase in the number of radio transmitters. One cosmological signal of extreme importance to astronomers is the 21 cm “spin flip” transition, indicating the presence of neutral hydrogen in the cosmos. This signal is emitted at 1420 MHz but received at a range of lower frequencies from very distant galaxies due to cosmological redshift. Detecting this weak signal can be difficult in the presence of interference from human-generated radio-frequency transmissions for wireless communications. This research project will use machine learning algorithms to better detect and mitigate such interference, which will enable detection of neutral hydrogen in the very early universe. Undergraduate students will participate in all aspects of this program, providing them with hands-on experience in key issues of spectrum management, space situational awareness, and machine learning algorithms. <br/><br/>Radio frequency interference (RFI) from satellite constellations poses a critical threat to observational radio astronomy experiments seeking to detect the 21 cm signal of neutral hydrogen across cosmic time. These highly sensitive experiments must integrate over a thousand hours to detect the redshifted 21 cm signal; even very faint RFI becomes a significant contaminant at these extreme sensitivities. Currently, no single RFI detection technique can effectively identify both very bright and very faint RFI (which can differ by as much as six orders of magnitude in signal strength). This research team will develop a weakly supervised machine learning framework that uses existing RFI detection techniques to create a self-consistent flagging strategy suitable for all events, from bright transmitters down to faint reflections of terrestrial signals off CubeSats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

126,Model Systems for Studying Carbohydrate-Carbohydrate Interactions,"With the support of the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Amit Basu of Brown University is studying how carbohydrates interact with each other in biological systems. Cell surfaces are coated with complex carbohydrates, also known as glycans, that mediate communication between cells and neighboring cells. A detailed molecular understanding of how these cell surface glycans engage with other cells is a prerequisite for being able to design molecules and materials that comprise new technologies that will interact with cells and tissues. Students and researchers working on this project will be trained in a variety of chemical and biophysical tools that will be used to identify the fundamental principles underlying glycan-mediated recognition. These scientists will move on to graduate school in chemistry and biology, medical school, and to jobs in higher education, the private sector, and government. This project will be used in a variety of outreach efforts that connect local schools with scientists who will share with young students how the tools of chemistry, biology, and physics are used to study the world around us.<br/><br/>Carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (CCI) between cell surface carbohydrates and glycolipids mediate cell-cell adhesion in a variety of biological processes, such as metastasis, development, and neural development. This project will focus on the role of three carbohydrates – galactose (Gal), glucose (Glc), and sulfo-galactose (sGal) – all found in the myelin sheath, a series of lipid bilayers that encircle axons. Previous studies have shown that CCI can be readily detected using various glycoconjugates and that the interaction is exquisitely carbohydrate specific. However, the detailed molecular basis for these interactions remain unknown. Thus, the broader question that this project seeks to is – can characterize carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions be better characterized at both a molecular and supramolecular level? More specifically, this project seeks to identify the structural features that contribute to CCIs and to determine the thermodynamic parameters of this interaction using a variety of biophysical tools, including NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and ITC (isothermal titration calorimetry).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
127,Heat transport in topological matter,"NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research, education, and outreach activities with a goal to achieve a fundamental understanding of topological matter by investigating how heat is transported within such matter. Topological matter is a new class of materials, which exhibit uniquely robust physical properties that are exceptionally stable to environmental effects. This property opens the door for many potential applications in measurement science, and more importantly, quantum information. These applications are related to the existence of elusive particles called anyons. <br/><br/>We normally think of electrons as having no parts. Yet, in topological matter they often behave as if they were made of composite particles called anyons. These anyons are promising for building the fundamental components of a quantum computer, in which topological protection would help reduce otherwise unavoidable computational errors introduced by the material's interaction with its environment. The nature and even the existence of anyons in many systems remain hotly debated. The primary focus of this award is to develop ways to probe the existence and nature of anyons. So far, various electronic experiments have been proposed and implemented for this purpose. Yet, electronic tools have significant limitations and do not work in systems that do not conduct electricity. However, this is not a limitation for heat transport. The key idea of this project consists of focusing on heat transport (rather than electronic transport) to understand anyons, and hence, topological matter. <br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the US workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through research training of undergraduate and graduate students, writing pedagogical review articles, organization of conferences and workshops, and outreach to K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports research, education, and outreach activities aimed at achieving a fundamental understanding of heat transport in topological matter. The last several years have witnessed several breakthroughs in the experimental detection of quantized thermal conductance, including the observation of its fractional quantization, which gives evidence of non-Abelian anyons. Yet, many aspects of topological heat transport remain poorly understood. <br/><br/>The project has two research thrusts. The first one focuses on the problems of heat dissipation and the interplay of the charge and heat transport, which are crucial for the interpretation of the experimental data. The second thrust builds on the idea of thermal interferometry of anyons. Interferometry is the most direct way to probe fractional statistics. During the last two years, there has been dramatic progress in the experimental implementation of interferometry of charged anyons. Building on these recent developments, this project will extend the idea of anyonic interferometry to neutral anyons and to systems that do not support electric currents. The project will address several related problems in interferometry of charged and neutral anyons and in topological heat transport at ultra-low temperatures. The technical approaches will combine conformal field theory, Keldysh technique, algebraic theory of anyons, refermionization, Bethe ansatz, and other tools. The research will benefit from interaction with experimentalists from the Weizmann Institute of Science. <br/><br/>This award also supports the PI's educational and outreach activities which contribute to the development of the STEM workforce in the US through research training of undergraduate and graduate students, writing pedagogical review articles, organization of conferences and workshops, and outreach to K-12 students and the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
128,CAREER: Testing the neural representation of sequences in nonhuman primate frontal cortex using fMRI-localized electrophysiology,"Humans and animals are great at keeping track of patterns that are important for survival and using this information to predict and respond the right way. For example, when sitting on a bus, we track the order of stops, so we can get ready, stand-up and exit at the right time. To make these responses, we must keep track of the order of individual events. In addition to tracking sequences, our lives are also shaped by our abilities to generate sequences, which are foundational for everything from tying shoelaces to forming a sentence or writing a symphony. Understanding and following sequences also underlies our ability to learn. Illnesses or injuries that impair this tracking can have devastating effects on normal life. However, despite the fundamental importance of tracking sequences, how our brain supports this ability is mostly unknown. Even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems cannot solve many sequential problems that humans and animals can easily perform. In addition to scientific research advancing understanding of the neural basis of sequences, this project also includes an extensive multipronged outreach effort: sharing the excitement of recent discoveries in neuroscience with educational events in the community, in schools and during research-themed fairs, teaching neuroscience to students with diverse backgrounds, and running an annual conference focused on encouraging and supporting women who wish to pursue a career in STEM fields.<br/><br/>To deepen our understanding of sequence representation, researchers will record brain activity from a model organism (macaque monkeys) during performance of auditory and visual sequence tracking tasks. This task will illuminate two ways the brain could track sequential information. For example, if a sequence is “ABCD”, one way to know what comes after “B” is to learn that “C” always comes after “B”. This would be a relational representation. Another way to know what comes next is that “C” is always the third item in the sequence – an ordinal representation. We hypothesize that different areas of the brain track these two different kinds of sequence information: the medial part of prefrontal cortex (MPFC) tracks ordinal position - which item goes with which place in the sequence (C is third), and the lateral part of prefrontal cortex (LPFC) receives ordinal information from MPFC to track which item goes with which place (C is third) and combines this with relational information about which item comes next (C after B). Researchers will record brain activity in two different ways while monkeys perform the task: by recording the activity of single cells in the PFC and other brain areas, and by whole brain neuroimaging (using functional magnetic resonance imaging - fMRI). Using these two complementary methods provides two independent kinds of evidence which can be integrated to give more insight into sequence representation. These experiments hold the promise of leading to a deeper understanding of how the brain tracks sequences and how the brain learns and performs complex tasks, which require a sequence of successive actions. The studies on sequence tracking tasks and sequence representation in non-human primates will illuminate and give insight into human cognition and the neural basis of human performance on similar sequencing tasks.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Cognitive Neuroscience Program and by the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
129,Collaborative Research: Experimental deformation of monazite and titanite: Implications for interpretation of petrochronologic data,"The deformation behavior of rocks controls the strength of the lithosphere, the location and intensity of earthquakes, the response of Earth to impact events, and the concentration and deposition of ore minerals. To understand the conditions and duration under which rocks deformed in the geologic past, and to improve understanding of earthquake processes, mineral resource identification, and crustal strength modelling, we will conduct a series of experiments on minerals important for geologic age dating. These deformation experiments will be conducted at conditions which simulate environments deep within the Earth’s crust. The principal investigators will fabricate synthetic rock samples embedded with natural mineral grains and use a rock deformation apparatus to impose high stress and strain conditions typical of deep Earth shear zones. The experiments will focus on the deformation behavior of accessory phase minerals titanite and monazite, which are routinely used for petrochronology, a technique which uses radiometric age dating to determine the timing of ancient metamorphic reactions and deformation events. The deformation behavior of the major rock-forming minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar, olivine) has been well-studied, but our experiments will be among the first to investigate the deformation behavior of accessory phase minerals. Accessory phase minerals, such as monazite, are reservoirs for Rare Earth Elements (REEs) and the results of our experiments will provide better understanding of REE mobilization within fault zones. Societal benefits of the project include direct training of graduate and undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher in experimental and analytical skills that are valuable in many high-level government, defense, and industrial laboratories. Outreach efforts will involve developing earth science curricula for Providence, RI elementary school. The Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences at Brown has an active outreach program known as the Science-Teaching and Education Program (STEP), which partners with local teachers to develop earth science modules in their classes. The project will also contribute to the broadening of underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to experimentally deform a selection of accessory phase minerals and use multiple advanced microanalytical techniques to examine how various deformation and recrystallization mechanisms affect the distribution of elements and isotopes important for geochronology. The researchers will conduct a multi-step experimental protocol consisting of deformation in a Griggs-rig solid medium deformation apparatus followed by high temperature static annealing of a subset of samples. Accessory phases monazite and titanite with well-characterized trace element contents will be embedded as porphyroclasts in a matrix of quartz, synthetic quartz, or feldspar and deformed under prescribed temperatures, pressures, and strain rate conditions. Multiple advanced analytical techniques will allow us to investigate the composition and structure of deformed samples from the aggregate to atomic scale. The principal investigators will quantify the influence of lattice defects on the mobility of impurity elements and consequences of recrystallization for interpreting the geochemistry of deformed minerals. Our results will provide fundamental constraints on the rheological behavior of accessory phase minerals and enable more confident applications of accessory phase geochronology and geothermometry to deformed rocks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
130,CAS: Collaborative Research: Integrative Learning of Fluorescence Fluctuations in Perovskite Quantum Dots Using A Data Science Assisted Single-Particle Approach,"With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Jing Zhao and Kun Chen of the University of Connecticut and Professor Ou Chen of Brown University are combining advanced fluorescence microscopy techniques with data science approaches to study the blinking behavior of individual perovskite quantum dots (QDs). The fluorescence coming from a single QD is not constant, but rather exhibits periods of light emission followed by periods of darkness. In short, they blink. Blinking is a universal behavior of QDs and understanding its mechanism is critical to many applications. However, determining the blinking mechanism is challenging because it must be studied in one QD at a time, and one must study many QDs to draw meaningful conclusions. To address this challenge, Professors Zhao, Chen, and Chen along with their students will apply modern statistical learning approaches to analyze fluorescence blinking in many perovskite QDs with varying compositions. The discoveries could have implications for how QDs are used in applications ranging from LED displays to biological imaging. The research methods and findings will be integrated into outreach activities and virtual chemistry laboratory modules, as well as workshops introducing data science techniques to chemistry students.<br/><br/>The project will apply modern statistical learning and data science approaches to analyze fluorescence fluctuations in single perovskite QDs with the goal of gaining mechanistic insight that is free of the implicit bias often encountered when interpreting data from single-particle measurements. The project will leverage the knowledge and knowhow from three investigators who are experts in materials science, single-particle spectroscopy, and modern data science approaches to measure and analyze the fluorescence signals of a large number of individual perovskite QDs. The team will examine QDs with varying composition in their cation and anion sites, compositions, and lattice distortions using optical microscopy techniques, and through the application of statistically rigorous analysis methods, gain a deeper understanding of the photophysical mechanisms that govern their blinking behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
131,Active Fluids in Externally Driven Flows,"This research will develop the theoretical framework for the design and control of active fluids. Active fluids are driven by energy which is added at the small scale of the particles that make up the fluid. For example, the cytosol in our cells flows because molecular motors consume energy-storing ATP molecules and use this energy to slide rigid biopolymers past each other. This sliding motion induces flows that can be used for cell crawling or the transport of biological materials within the cell. There is currently great interest in developing artificial active matter systems, such as a microfluidic device which pumps itself. Understanding the hydrodynamic properties of active fluids is essential if they are ever to be of practical use in medicine or industry. The focus of this research is to mathematically model the flow of an active fluid when it is subject to an externally driven flow, such as the flow driven by a pump. The results of theoretical calculations will be compared with experiments to determine the parameters that control the nature of active flow. This research will support the scientific training of undergraduate and graduate students. The PIs will mentor undergraduates from historically underrepresented groups in engineering and physical science through the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program. Topics related to this work will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate courses in engineering and physics. <br/><br/>There are very few studies of active matter subject to external flows. The goal of this research is to study the fluid dynamics of active gels, i.e. active apolar filaments that are sufficiently dilute that they tend not to spontaneously align and form a liquid crystalline phase. Linear stability analysis and numerical computation will be used to study the activity-driven flow transitions in active gels in two dimensions subject to external flows of Couette, Poiseuille, and Taylor-Couette types. Simulations will be used to explore the effect of confinement on active gels in lid-driven cavity flow. Finally, three-dimensional channel flows of active gels will be studied, as well as the drag forces and torques and spontaneous motion of objects in an active gel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
132,Collaborative Research: Quantifying the effects of Langmuir Turbulence on Sea Ice and The Arctic Ocean,"This project will improve our capability for predicting how floating sea ice and the ocean evolve in the Arctic Ocean. To do this, we will develop a computer model for examining how ocean surface waves interact with sea ice and run simulations to improve predictions of how the heat and salt move up and down in the ocean. This new model will be shared for free, helping other scientists carry out new research into these processes, and making it easier for students to learn about the Arctic Ocean, its sea ice, and its changing behavior in a warming world. The project will support several early-career scientists in their training and research, including two students. <br/> <br/>Floating sea ice is an important part of the climate system as it reflects sunlight and acts as a barrier that separates the ocean from the atmosphere. The presence of sea ice is crucial in determining how warm the Arctic Ocean is and will become. The ocean surface also moves up and down due to waves, which are one of the main ways that the heat and salt of surface waters contact and mix with the deep ocean. Wave-related mixing is important across the global ocean, but we do not currently understand its impact in regions of sea ice. This is because sea ice changes the waves and their movement, affecting how surface and deep waters mix. This project addresses this uncertainty by identifying when and where wave-related mixing is occurring in the Arctic, and by understanding how floating sea ice impacts the strength of this mixing. We will use small-scale computer modeling experiments, informed by observations, to create a new way to account for this mixing in the global climate models used to predict Earth’s future. As part of this work, we will develop and publicly share a computer code that simulates ocean mixing under various Arctic conditions, including both ice and waves. This code will broadly aid Arctic oceanographers and will be used in classes to train ocean modelers at Oregon State University and Brown University. This project will support 5 people who are early in their scientific career, ranging from an undergraduate student to two assistant professors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
133,Collaborative Research: A Coordinate-Free Framework for Improving Eddy Parameterizations,"This project is to create and apply a new theoretical framework for developing and assessing parameterizations of eddy transport in numerical models. The framework constitutes a set of principles linking physical meaning to parameterization form, including extant as well as yet-unformulated variations. This work will provide an avenue for the cross-evaluation of existing or proposed parameterizations from first principles. Two significant software packages that will result from this work are (i) symbolic algebra software for implementing eddy parameterizations in an arbitary model coordinate system and choice of discretization, and (ii) numerical code for error diagnostics in model implementation.<br/><br/>The Explicit, Stochastic, Coordinate-independent (ESC) framework will incorporate: (i) explicit and rigorous definitions for filtering and averaging operations; (ii) a flexible approach to stochastic modeling that relaxes the unrealistic constraints implicit in existing parameterizations on eddy path smoothness and dependence on local conditions; and (iii) the use of coordinate-independent representations to express the physical essence of parameterizations free from choice of model geometry. This work will clarify the link between parameterization forms and conserved properties (energy, enstrophy, etc.); speed the identification and assessment of discretization errors in multiple model systems; uniquely identify the advective and diffusive components of parameterized fluxes across implementations; and account for the impact of the observed range of high-frequency trajectory behavior on parameterization structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
134,The Geometry of Curves in Projective Space via Degeneration and Deformation,"Systems of polynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematics, and related fields such as physics, cryptography, and other sciences. When such a system describes a one-dimensional object, the corresponding geometric object is known as an algebraic curve. Broadly speaking, this project studies the geometry of algebraic curves, both individually and as they vary in families. One specific question this project investigates is the concept of interpolation: When can a certain type of curve be passed through a general collection of points? In other words, one can draw a line through any two points in the plane and draw a circle through any three points in the plane, unless those three points lie on a line. More generally, the PI will consider what happens for other types of curves in higher-dimensional spaces, assuming again that the points do not lie in any special configurations. This project also includes training for undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The project considers various questions for the investigation of the structure of the equations of general curves. For example, in what degrees are they generated? What is the Betti table of a general divisor on such a curve? The PI will also investigate certain natural vector bundles on curves that control their deformation theory --- the restricted tangent bundle and the normal bundle --- and study how they break down into stable vector bundles, which are the atomic building blocks of all vector bundles. Finally, the PI will study the geometry of moduli spaces of curves, focusing on their integral intersection theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
135,Hybrid Methods for Statistical and Econometric Modeling,"This research project will develop statistical methods that account for the unavoidable fact that most models only represent approximations to reality, and researchers often are faced with a choice of a number of different plausible models. The project will tackle this issue along three fronts: (i) by devising a modification to the widely used method-of-moment approaches from economics and statistics that account for imperfectly measured data, (ii) by providing formal statistical methods that account for the fact that researchers typically adapt the complexity of their model based on the amount of data they have, and (iii) by developing forecasting methods that combine the predictions of multiple (possibly imperfect) models to yield more robust forecasts. To accomplish this, techniques developed in very diverse fields of study will be combined and augmented, and their advantages in contexts very different from where they initially were conceived will be leveraged. The methods to be developed generally can be applied in many areas of study that employ statistical modeling and thus could impact fields as diverse as medicine, weather forecasting, pandemic evolution predictions, climate modeling, or the evaluation of the effectiveness of social intervention programs. Graduate students will be involved in the research process, and computer programs implementing the new methods will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This research project will solve the problem of assigning a logical interpretation to the method of moments when the data rejects the model. The problem will be addressed by determining the minimum amount of measurement error that would be needed to reach agreement between the data and the model. This approach will draw from two currently very active areas of research, namely, empirical likelihood and optimal transport. Another part of the project will provide researchers with methods to account for their model selection process when making statistical inference by leveraging techniques from the general field of nonstandard inference. Finally, the project will exploit the largely overlooked fact that a multi-model forecasting process can be written as a model selection problem, where the model selection variables can be set-valued, thus emphasizing a connection with the so-called set-identified models, which have received considerable attention in recent years. The research will provide a natural frequentist counterpart to the commonly used Bayesian approaches to multi-model forecasts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
136,Experiments in teacher professional learning: Testing design features that accelerate instructional improvement in mathematics,"Teacher professional learning is a critical part of the mathematics education landscape. For decades, professional learning has been the primary strategy for developing the skills of the teaching workforce and changing how teachers interact with students in classrooms around academic content. Professional learning also can be expensive for districts, both financially and in terms of teacher time. Given these investments, most school leaders wish to spend their professional development dollars efficiently, making decisions about professional learning design that maximize teacher and student learning. However, despite more than two decades of rigorous research on professional learning programs, practitioners have little causal evidence on which professional learning design features work to accelerate teacher learning. This project seeks to identify features of teacher professional learning experiences that lead to better mathematics outcomes for both teachers and students. <br/><br/>The project explores this central question through a series of randomized experiments in a range of districts across the country. The project leverages a research-practice partnership known as the Research Partnership for Professional Learning (RPPL) that brings together large-scale providers of math curriculum-focused professional development with researchers at Brown and Harvard Universities. Together, researchers and RPPL collaborators will conduct experimental A/B tests of professional learning features indicated as promising by both theory and, where available, prior evidence. Because these experiments will be housed within RPPL providers’ regularly-provided services to districts, experiments can be conducted efficiently and generate knowledge quickly. The project seeks to explore three critical topics and whether they make a difference in the efficacy of the teacher professional learning: whether to emphasize conceptual or concrete approaches to teacher change; ways to enhance teacher agency in professional learning settings; and ways to increase the persistence—or “stickiness”—of teacher learning. The project will model changes using data sources that include measures of teacher instructional practice, student learning, and artifacts from the professional learning enactments.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
137,Thermally Activated Dynamics in 2D Colloidal Glasses and Crystals,"Non-technical abstract: <br/><br/>In this project, the team seeks to uncover the microscopic mechanism(s) by which many materials change suddenly from a liquid to a solid without the usual crystallization process. The most familiar one is the window glass. Whether the window glass is a slowly aging liquid or a true solid is a longstanding unresolved question in science. Building on the recent research in two-dimensional (2D) colloidal glasses, the team plans to use both experiment and theory to study the origin(s) of the glass transition. The experimental and theoretical activities will benefit each other, providing motivation and testing of the hypotheses. The results of this research can benefit scientists and engineers in designing new materials. For example, understanding the mechanism(s) of how impurities or particle size variations impact the stability of the glassy material may allow scientists to artificially engineer such impurities to improve the properties of the materials, similar to introducing impurities into superconductors to make stronger magnets. The proposed research provides excellent training for two Ph.D. students, and undergraduate and master students in condensed matter physics. Training the next generation American scientists in materials science is of great importance in maintaining the US preeminence in science and technology. <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/><br/>The team plans to use video microscopy and Monte Carlo simulations to study two sets of related questions in condensed matter physics: (1) What is the microscopic mechanism in the recently discovered 2D colloidal glasses of anisotropic particles? (2) Does an array of edge dislocations formed along a low-angle grain boundary in a 2D colloidal crystal undergo a finite temperature phase transition and what happens to the phase transition when there are impurity particles in the hosting 2D crystal? The underlying fundamental question is how phases of matter and phase transitions are impacted by disorder. The first project will investigate the physical mechanism of a two-step 2D colloidal glass transition of rods. The proposed experiments will be used to distinguish various competing scenarios of the glass transition in 2D. The second project is to study a possible novel phase transition in an array of edge dislocations formed along a low-angle grain boundary in a 2D colloidal crystal and the effects of disorder on the phase transition and dynamics. The results will have a significant impact on the understanding of defects and the glassy states in condensed matter systems. The results of this research can help scientists and engineers in designing new materials for the benefit of society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
138,Hamiltonian Methods for Dispersive Fluids and Plasmas,"Physical phenomena related to galaxies, gases, and plasmas can be modeled by the partial differential equations describing fluid motions. This project addresses several aspects of such equations, including the qualitative and quantitative study of their asymptotic behavior and the stability of various equilibriums (stable equilibriums correspond to objects that can be encountered/observed). An underlying theme of the project is to develop robust methods to leverage the stabilizing mechanisms of dispersion (the fact that, since all objects move constantly in an infinite space, a high concentration at any given point at any given time becomes increasingly unlikely as time passes). Another central theme of the project is to study the effect of rotation on fluids. While it has been already recognized that this induces a stabilizing dispersive effect, the extent of this effect, its precise mathematical expression, and its consequences, remain largely unknown. This project will also contribute to preparing the next generation of scientists by training graduate students, developing courses, as well as collaborative opportunities. <br/><br/>This project addresses various stability and asymptotic questions on kinetic and fluid equations, using the dispersive mechanism to obtain long-time control of the solutions. For kinetic equations, a goal is to understand the long-time behavior of solutions with a point charge part, using (and developing) the method of asymptotic action-angle. A first example is the stability of a Dirac mass, in the repulsive or (tentatively) the attractive case. A second question is to investigate the case of large data and the extension to the relativistic case. Another problem addressed concerns homogeneous equilibrium with an aim to better understand Landau damping (in the whole space). The PI will consider a model of fat-tail equilibria (the Poisson equilibrium) and will prove stability, by decomposing the electric field into an electrostatic contribution with faster decay and an oscillatory component that dissipates slowly. Using normal form techniques, the PI will prove that the long-time contribution of the slow but oscillatory component remains under control, and will close with a bootstrap argument based on Lebesgue norm of the density alone. Other generalizations will also be pursued. Finally, this project also considers situations where the rotation induces a stabilizing decaying mechanism, starting with global stability of the vector field of rigid motion for the incompressible 3d Euler. This in turn reduces to a problem of small data global existence for a quasilinear dispersive problem, which will be tackled using methods originating from the space-time resonance method and extensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
139,Collaborative Research: SaTC: CORE: Medium: The Next Generation of Leakage Attacks and Defenses for Encrypted Databases,"growing number of works explore the area of encrypted databases as a practical approach to searching on encrypted data stored at a server. The client encrypts the data before uploading it to the server. The server is not given the decryption key, yet the server can execute searches on the encrypted data requested by the client and return the corresponding encrypted answers. An encrypted database efficiently achieves the above functionality by allowing some leakage about the original (plaintext) data that appears harmless but could be exploited by an attacker who attempts to reconstruct the original data by synthesizing leakage from the encrypted answers and encrypted queries over time. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop the next generation of methods for building efficient encrypted databases and for analyzing their resilience to reconstruction attacks. To achieve this goal, it uses methods from algorithms, statistics, geometry, databases, and computer systems. Specific research activities include cryptanalysis of the leakage from encrypted databases with suppressed leakage as well as cryptanalysis and schemes for high-dimensional encrypted queries. Informed by the above research thrusts, this project will develop a principled analysis of defenses as well as a framework for quantifying the impact of leakage in the context of encrypted databases. <br/><br/>Toward achieving broader impacts, this project includes curriculum development for computer security courses, efforts to include members of underrepresented groups in research activities, and outreach to industry and government audiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
140,"Non-Binding Suggestions, Self-Enforcing Norms and the Determinants of Cooperation in Repeated Games","It is often difficult to achieve the common good in the face of opportunistic incentives. Repeated interaction can alleviate this difficulty: rewards and punishments in future interactions can possibly overcome shortsighted considerations. Cooperation then becomes a possibility, but not a necessity. The project experimentally investigates the self-sustainability of such cooperative norms, and addresses the question of how to make better norms focal. Society often expects leaders (such as CEOs, politicians, and school principals) to make pronouncements in the hope that such 'soft nudges' impact institutional culture and norms. This project investigates whether it is feasible, through the power of suggestion, to effect and sustain desired outcomes in the context of repeated relationships and communities. It will shed light on the determinants of leadership’s ability to shift behavior towards desirable outcomes; investigate which suggested behaviors yield the greatest adherence, and which have little hope of emerging; examine whether suggestions have persistent effects; and consider whether suggestions couched in moral language are more effective than those phrased in neutral language.<br/><br/>The social dilemma is pervasive but theoretically solvable in the context of repeated interactions. Yet theory only reveals that the set of possible outcomes expands. It does not shed light on how to bring about an equilibrium achieving the desired societal outcomes. The recent experimental literature on repeated games considers what norms will spontaneously crystallize in the lab, after filtering out transitory behavior. However, the equilibrium that arises in the lab may not come close to those arising in richer settings, where historical context, strategies' shared meaning, and pre-play communication play a role. As such, current experiments may be overly harsh when it comes to assessing the limits of cooperation: not seeing cooperation spontaneously emerge may not reflect the full potential for cooperation in real-life problems. A laboratory environment cannot recreate the many ways in which an equilibrium might become focal. This study takes the more modest approach of testing the self-enforcing nature of different strategies using non-binding suggestions, akin to the pronouncements made by leaders. This does not require having to witness the self-emergence of strategies, nor does it require introducing uncontrolled elements that defy the purposes of a lab setting. Failing to voluntarily follow a non-binding suggestion of some cooperative equilibrium strategies is evidence that it is unlikely to spontaneously crystallize and persist in real life. The methodology involves varying the continuation probability, as a natural treatment-control for demand effects arising from statements made by third parties (in this case, the experimenter). This study will investigate many questions, including whether efficiency is higher when making a non-binding suggestion such as grim-trigger or tit-for-tat strategies, as opposed to when letting a convention emerge spontaneously; and how non-binding suggestions interact with previously studied determinants of cooperation (e.g., the role of risk dominance, risk aversion and altruism). In addition to standard repeated games, this project will also explore the empirical validity of established theoretical notions of community enforcement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
141,Geometry and Arithmetic of Brill--Noether Loci and Brill--Noether curves,"Polynomial equations are ubiquitous in mathematics, physics, and other sciences. One can study a system of polynomial equations geometrically, by thinking about the shape formed by these solutions, as well as arithmetically, by considering what types of numbers arise in solutions. This project studies the relationship between the geometry and arithmetic in the one-dimensional case of algebraic curves. Broadly, this project will investigate the possible explicit realizations of an abstract algebraic curve by polynomial equations (so-called Brill-Noether theory), which informs both the geometry of the curve, as well as its arithmetic of solutions over bounded extensions of the rational numbers. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students and work with members of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PI will initiate the arithmetic Brill-Noether theory program to elucidate the structure of the rational points on Brill-Noether loci in the Picard variety of a curve. This has applications to determining the low degree points on curves defined over number fields. The PI will also investigate analogues of the classic Brill-Noether theorem when the curve is special in moduli due to a low degree realization in projective space. In particular, when the curve has a low degree map to the projective line, the PI will study the relationship with affine permutations and the affine Grassmannian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
142,Collaborative Research: Rare Earth Materials Under Extreme Conditions,"Non-technical summary <br/>Rare earths are a group of chemical elements used extensively in batteries, cell phones, protective coatings, and high melting ceramics. Their stability and suitability for such applications are governed by their physical, electrical, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties, all of which are closely related to their structure. With support from the Ceramics Program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research, this project brings together computational theory and experimental structural and thermodynamic measurements to provide fundamental data and predictive understanding of the behavior of high-melting solid rare earth compounds containing oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon. The experiments are guided by computational predictions of stability and structure made by state-of-the art physical theory and machine learning. High pressure is used as a tool to discover and synthesize new rare earth materials. Specialized high temperature calorimetric techniques measure thermodynamic properties. The thermodynamic data will be made available in a database for use by both academic and industrial scientists. The new knowledge obtained enables future design of more efficient and earth-friendly materials and devices containing rare earth elements. Additionally, students are trained through this project in a variety of techniques, preparing them for careers in many fields, including materials science, ceramics, semiconductor technology, and aerospace science.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/>Continuing a long-standing collaboration between experimental and computational scientists, this project, supported by the Ceramics Program in NSF’s Division of Materials Research, focuses on the thermodynamic and structural properties of refractory rare earth containing ceramic materials.

High pressure samples are synthesized in a multi-anvil apparatus at Arizona State University (ASU). Thermodynamic properties are determined by oxide melt solution calorimetry, high temperature scanning calorimetry, and drop and catch calorimetry. High temperature phase transitions are studied by synchrotron diffraction techniques. Specific systems of interest include rare earth monoxides, oxycarbides, and sesquioxides, with emphasis on their structure and properties at high temperature and pressure.

143,SaTC: CORE: Small: Mercurial Signatures and Applications to Privacy-Preserving Authentication,"Anonymous credentials allow individuals to prove that they have a set of credentials, issued by some trusted issuer, or a set of issuers, without revealing any other information. Thus, for example, using anonymous credentials, an access provider can make sure that only authorized individuals get to participate in transactions and gain access to various resources, without invading the individuals' privacy.<br/> <br/>In spite of decades of research, the existence of several implementations and some examples of adoption, practitioners have yet to adopt this technology en masse. One reason that practitioners are having a tough time wrapping their minds around anonymous credentials is that the underlying concepts are complex and have yet to enter the popular lexicon. Another issue is that traditional anonymous credentials do not in fact protect users' privacy as much as we want them to. Efficiency, bandwidth and other practical considerations play a role too.<br/> <br/>This work addresses these gaps by studying mercurial signatures. Conceptually, mercurial signatures are easier to explain to software engineers and decision makers than traditional anonymous credentials, because unlike the latter they do not require familiarity with cryptographic commitments and zero-knowledge proof systems. Instead, they build off intuition that, by now, many practitioners have from standard digital signatures when it comes to unforgeability, and probabilistic encryption when it comes to unlinkability. They immediately lend themselves to privacy-preserving certification chains and delegatable anonymous credentials. And their efficient realization translates to efficient privacy-preserving authentication with strong composition guarantees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
144,Collaborative Proposal: Tectonic degassing as a possible solution to the Miocene climate enigma,"About 20 million years ago, the Earth was much warmer than today and the Antarctic was nearly ice-free. However, a mysterious climatic transition happened around 14 million years ago and the Earth went through a series of cooling events since then. The persistent cooling over millions of years ultimately led to the emergence of the bi-polar icehouse climate of today. Scientists have long been puzzled about what processes could have caused the cooling. One idea is that the rise of the Himalayas mountains may have sped up erosion and increased the rate of chemical weathering, a process that draws down atmospheric carbon dioxide. Other scientists suggest that the cooling may have been caused by a slowdown in the supply of carbon dioxide from deep inside the earth. The idea is that the formation rate of oceanic crustal rocks decelerated about 14 million years ago. That would have caused a decrease in the release of carbon dioxide from the Earth's interior into the atmosphere. The decrease in the supply of that greenhouse gas then led to the decrease in global temperatures. This study will help address this cooling mystery by providing improved estimates of past global temperatures. Those estimates will come from analyses of organic molecules preserved in deep-sea sediments and from climate model simulations. The new global temperature reconstruction will help determine the relative contributions of mountain building and carbon dioxide release from the Earth's interior to changes in the carbon cycle. The study will provide a better picture of how tectonic processes on Earth, both on land and at the sea floor, influence long-term global climate. The project broader impacts include support for a postdoctoral researcher at both institutions, support for a graduate student and undergraduate researchers at Brown University, and support for K-12 focused outreach activity through an existing program at Brown University.<br/><br/>Beginning in the Middle Miocene (~14 Ma), the Earth experienced sustained cooling of 10-12 degrees C that ended the generally warm climate that had prevailed since the Mesozoic. A major enigma about this Miocene climate transition is whether it is driven by reduced carbon dioxide degassing (source) or enhanced weathering removal (sink). Assuming a relatively constant seafloor spreading rate over time, previous studies suggest that the carbon dioxide drawdown (and the global cooling) was caused by enhanced chemical weathering. That could have been due to either the uplift of the Himalayas or the emergence of the tropical maritime continent, which exposed easily weathered volcanic material in one of the warmest, wettest areas of the world. Recent sea surface temperature reconstructions, however, reveal that the Middle Miocene was much warmer than previously thought, raising the puzzle of whether reduced weathering alone is sufficient to sustain the large warming; an enhanced carbon dioxide flux is probably required to balance the expected weathering sink of carbon dioxide under warm Middle Miocene conditions. This study is motivated by a challenge to the weathering hypothesis based on recent evidence of a ~30% reduction in global crustal production rate since 15 Ma. This project will generate new biomarker sea surface temperature estimates with global coverage for the Miocene, filling temporal and spatial gaps of current datasets. Along with proxy analysis, the study will also develop new Miocene climate simulations sampling a wide range of model physics and boundary conditions to reproduce the Miocene large-scale temperature and hydrological cycle. The model simulations will be used to probe source/sink configurations compatible with Miocene temperatures and mass balance in the carbon cycle. By synthesizing the model-data information, the project will develop an improved reconstruction of the Miocene climate which will ultimately allow for estimation of the relative contribution of different source-sink terms (i.e., the Himalayas, the maritime continent, and the carbon dioxide degassing associated with seafloor spreading) in driving the Miocene temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
145,The Impact of Covid-19 on the Educational and Career Outcomes of First-Generation College Students and their Families,"The Covid-19 pandemic has greatly disrupted the education of first-generation college students—those whose parents did not complete a college degree. These students and their parents are often low-income, racial/ethnic minorities, and/or of an immigrant background. Compared to other families, they have fewer resources to absorb the impact of the educational and social crises stemming from the pandemic, but also have more at stake in completing a college degree. In families of first-generation college students, parents and children strive together for individual and collective success based on the belief that higher education will advance the family's economic mobility, improve their social status, and help them fulfill their obligations to each other. This research examines how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the educational and life goals of first-generation college student families and the actions taken in support of these goals. The project findings, to be shared in public-facing documents and web-based formats including a public archive, informs university supports and social services for vulnerable learners and families. This project is jointly funded by Cultural Anthropology and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/> <br/>The project hypothesizes that the Covid-19 pandemic has led first-generation college students and their families to prioritize caretaking actions aimed at immediate practical needs over the longer- term goals of better lives enabled by education. This hypothesis will be investigated through three years of data collection and analysis. Sixty parent-student pairs will each participate in: 1) two years of monthly journaling on the Pandemic Journaling Project (PJP) platform, created by two of the PIs in May 2020; 2) two one-on-one interviews with researchers; and 3) two interviews conducted between parent and student. These varied methods will capture families' shifting thinking, goals, and actions in relation to education and well-being. Understanding these perspectives and choices will advance theories of how families seek to create meaningful lives through both education and caregiving in the wake of crisis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
146,Iron-sulfur Clusters as Biological Sensors: Mechanistic Investigations by Synthetic Modeling Studies,"With the support of the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Eunsuk Kim from Brown University is studying the development of synthetic modeling systems to understand how iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters act as sensors for environmental signals. Iron-sulfur clusters are ubiquitous cofactors present in all animal kingdoms. Organisms have evolved to exploit the inherent reactivity of Fe-S clusters with small molecules like O2 and NO to assess their environment. For example, bacteria sense environmental O2 and NO and adjust their gene expression profiles for survival using regulatory proteins that contain Fe-S clusters. The human Fe-S mitoNEET protein acts as a redox sensor and regulates mitochondrial functions, failure of which leads to metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The proposed study will offer molecular insights into the modification and repair of iron-sulfur clusters by small redox signaling molecules. Molecular insights gained in this project will inform research focused on the development of biomarkers for disease detection, of antimicrobial agents, and of therapeutics for metabolic diseases. Students who will implement the research will gain knowledge, expertise and skills in chemical synthesis, reactivity, structural characterization of molecules, and spectroscopy. This project is also integrated into an outreach program focused on the improvement of the educational environments of students from groups underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and students from public high schools. <br/><br/>This research project seeks to understand strategies used by Fe-S regulatory proteins to battle oxidative and nitrosative stress at the molecular level. This goal is achieved by studying the geometric and electronic structure, reactivity, and bonding properties of discrete biomimetic, model Fe-S complexes. The chemical reactivity of Fe-S clusters will be studied in three different areas. Firstly, mechanistic details for the reactions of 4Fe-4S clusters with NO will be examined. These include the characterization of novel iron nitrosyl products and investigations on how reactive sulfur species are generated through the action of NO upon Fe-S clusters. Secondly, mitoNEET model clusters will be synthesized and bonding properties of the Fe-S cluster will be correlated to cluster transfer activity. Lastly, persulfide-ligated Fe-S clusters will be synthesized used to study the role of persulfides in the Fe-S repair process. Overall then, these fundamental mechanistic and spectroscopic studies have real promise to enhance understanding of Fe-S complexes in biology, in general, and their specific roles in electron transfer-initiated processes including interactions with signaling molecules such as NO and persulfides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
147,Static and Dynamic Properties of Magnetic Skyrmions and Their Applications,"Nontechnical Abstract<br/><br/>This award supports experimental research and education to advance basic knowledge in spintronics and magnetism. Spintronics uses electron spin to construct highly performing electronic devices beyond the conventional semiconductor chips. The magnetic entities or particles that the research team investigates are called magnetic skyrmions, tiny magnetic swirls that arise in two-dimensional materials that can be used for computing and information storage. Through the research efforts, the team can effectively control the motion of skyrmions and construct skyrmionic devices, thereby providing a research platform to train the next generation of scientists in spintronics. The principal investigator (PI) plans to develop new fabrication processes and characterization techniques that could lead to revolutionary computing, security, and sensing devices.

Skyrmion-enabled devices consume low power or less expensive materials, which mitigates climate change. With great potential in discovery and invention, this research project furthers the United States’ competitive edge in the electronics industry and help maintain leadership in advanced research, manufacturing, and innovation. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to understand the static and dynamic properties of magnetic skyrmions in magnetic multilayers, by exploring the interactions between skyrmions and various excitations including the magnetic field and spin current. The PI aims to achieve an understanding of the static, global and local dynamic behavior of skyrmions, both individually and collectively as clusters. The experimental approach utilizes state-of-the-art sample fabrication, submicron lithography, advanced imaging techniques and highly sensitive electronic measurements. The research team relies on micromagnetic simulations, electron magnetotransport theory, and condensed matter physics on spin-orbit coupling.

148,The role of intercellular interactions in bacterial swarming motility,"Non-technical Abstract:<br/><br/>Bacteria live in our surroundings, including in our own bodies. Understanding their ability to move is important for controlling them for the benefit of our environment and public health. This research program focuses on the study of swarms of bacteria on a moist surface. The work is performed on a newly discovered species of bacteria called Enterobacter sp. SM3, which manifests robust swarming abilities. The goal of the program is to examine how cell-cell interactions in a crowded population of bacteria affect their movement. The bacterial swarms will be characterized as active matter. Understanding the role of cell-cell interactions in bacterial swarms will aid in the control and treatment of large bacterial populations in environmental situations, such as large mats of bacteria known as biofilms, and in the microbiomes of human and animal intestines. The program will directly fund one PhD dissertation and provide training to several master’s and undergraduate students as research assistants, including undergraduate students from a historically black college for summer research.<br/> <br/>Technical Abstract:<br/> <br/>The goal of the study is to assess the extent to which intercellular interactions define the swarming motility in a dense bacterial population. The team seeks to observe and characterize specific patterns and collective motion of a large bacterial population under properly designed conditions that vary intercellular interactions, such as dynamic alignment, hydrodynamic entrainment, and flagella entanglement. They also seek to uncover additional interactions mediated either by secreted extracellular matrix materials or by added polymers which serve as a viscoelastic medium. The objective is to account for observed patterns and features of collective motility based on the principles of active matter physics. If successful, the program will provide new insights, not only on bacterial swarming behavior, but also on the collective behavior of individually motile particles in general. The work will further establish bacterial swarms as biologically significant active matter with a range of emergent properties. The program integrates knowledge across the diverse fields of soft matter physics, microbiology, and fluid dynamics. In addition to the direct impact on active matter physics research, the work may also lead to applications in ecology and infection control guided by concepts and strategy rooted in soft matter physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
149,Collaborative Proposal: Testing Collision Versus Frictional Stress-Drop Models of High-Frequency Earthquake Ground Motions,"Earthquakes are ubiquitous natural hazards that impact vulnerable populations near active fault systems across the globe. Despite longstanding and intensive research by the scientific community, several key aspects of the earthquake rupture process remain poorly understood. This project focuses on understanding the physical origin of the high-frequency seismic energy that is generated during the rupture process as earthquake faults slip past one another. These advances in scientific understanding have broad implications for earthquake hazard mitigation, informing how future building design codes should be constructed in order to prevent earthquake damage to vulnerable structures. The project also supports early career scientists and provides research opportunities to traditionally underrepresented groups in the geosciences. Through targeted outreach efforts, the project will engage high school students from a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds, with an aim toward experiential learning that will guide them in their future careers.<br/><br/>The physical origins for high-frequency ground motions have traditionally been explained in terms of a frictional model that postulates that frictional processes during fault slip determine rupture properties like stress drop, which in turn control shaking amplitudes. However, these classical frictional models often struggle to explain many aspects of the high-frequency ground motions observed in nature. This discrepancy has led to the hypothesis that elastic impacts of fault-zone structures that occur to accommodate the geometric complexity of fault systems may play an important role in the generation of high-frequency ground motions. The project will explicitly test this hypothesis using three sets of seismological observations – corner frequencies, radiation patterns, and the ratio of S-wave to P-wave radiated energy – for which the frictional and impact models make distinctly different predictions. This work has a number of important implications for our understanding of the physics of earthquake rupture, including determining the degree to which detailed measurements of fault zone structure are needed to make accurate ground motion predictions, revising the physical interpretation of seismological stress drop estimates, and constraining the degree of wave scattering in the Earth’s crust. These advances, taken holistically, will provide crucial observational constraints for future earthquake hazard mitigation efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
150,"Collaborative Research: Non-homogeneous Harmonic Analysis, Spectral Theory, and Weighted Norm Estimates","Singular integrals are mathematical objects that feature heavily in the study of partial differential equations, with applications ranging from physics to engineering to quantum computing. The mathematical theory of singular integrals has traditionally been formulated in smooth geometric settings. However, demand for an understanding of singular integrals in rougher settings has grown recently with a more refined understanding of mathematical models for physical phenomena in irregular or non-smooth environments. Emerging applications of singular integrals in quantum computing further buttress the need for such extensions of the classical theory. Notably, the relationship between singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures facilitates a new understanding of dimension reduction for high-dimensional point sets, that is, mechanisms to detect whether large collections of points in a high-dimensional space in fact lie on a smooth lower-dimensional manifold. Results of this nature are important for data science applications, and the project has the potential to bring the toolkit of singular integral theory to bear on this important application domain. By coupling pure harmonic analysis methods with tools from combinatorics and probability, and through its noticeable interface with questions of relevance in data science, the project will also provide opportunities for the training of junior mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers a variety of questions in the study of singular integrals in non-smooth or rough settings, using both existing and newly developed tools. The principal investigators have been at the forefront of the past development of such a theory, and the current project will crystallize new applications to other areas of geometry and analysis. Questions under consideration in this project include: (a) a sharp characterization of bounded singular integrals with matrix weight, which is important in the regularity theory of vector stationary stochastic processes, (b) a characterization of weighted boundedness for para-product singular operators on graphs with cycles (multi-trees, Hamming cubes, etc.), and (c) the David-Semmes regularity problem in codimensions larger than one. The latter topic ties the project to questions in geometric measure theory and to the study of dimension reduction, with concomitant implications for the geometry of large data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
151,CAREER: Robot Perception of Human Physical Skills,"This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>Everyday human activities are impressive feats of physical intelligence - from careful placement of feet to avoid obstacles when walking, to the precise and highly coordinated movement of fingers to type a sentence. Robots with even a fraction of human physical intelligence could revolutionize lives by automating repetitive tasks. Despite advances however, robots with such physical abilities remain elusive. This project takes a step towards more capable robots by building 3D computer vision and machine learning algorithms for automatically analyzing human skills from large-scale image and video collections readily available on the internet or captured in the wild. It will produce a large repository of high-level physical skills that can then be transferred to robots. The education and outreach activities of the project will impart theoretical knowledge in robot perception and provide practical experience to graduates, undergraduates, and high school students. Furthermore, the project will lead to advances in computer vision-based understanding of human physical skills, in-the-wild capture of a significant amount of skills data and help to solve problems outside of CS such as in the study of the neuroscience of hand manipulation in monkeys.<br/><br/>To meet the research goals, the project will advance the state of the art in computer vision-based modeling and estimation of human physical skills from large-scale visual data. Existing methods are limited to operating in structured environments and cannot capture interactions in unconstrained visual data taken in cluttered environments like homes. To address this limitation, the project will build (1) neural networks to model and estimate human physical properties such as shape and articulation from unconstrained data, (2) neural networks that model and estimate human motion and interaction from videos, and (3) methods for gathering and analyzing large amounts (10,000 person-hours) of unconstrained videos of human activities to build a repository of physical skills. This repository will inform the transfer of skills from humans to robots. The long-term aim of this research is to demonstrate that learning from images and videos is a viable path for robots to gain human-like physical abilities. To meet the education and outreach goals, the project will integrate theory and practice by acquiring several cameras and robot arms to teach an advanced course, a semester-long undergraduate research experience program, and a virtual workshop program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
152,CAREER: Cameras and Algorithms that turn Rays Efficiently into Everyday Reconstructions,"This award is funded in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>This project aims to enable people to capture digital versions of real-world scenes more accurately, efficiently, and flexibly than is currently possible such that it can be a simple everyday task. In computer vision, capture of the real world is called reconstruction, and it is a core challenge that requires estimating the 3D shape, motion, object materials, and lighting within a scene. Successful reconstruction can provide spatial and geometric information of objects independent from lighting conditions to intelligent systems so that they can use the information for reasoning or creating applications of these objects from different viewing angles, e.g., in virtual and augmented reality. This project will scientifically investigate how to overcome the challenges of reconstruction by combining signals from different types of cameras in a way that is consistent with the physics of image formation. The project will integrate research and education by creating new interdisciplinary courses and promoting diversity from different outreach activities, e.g., supporting our K-12 AI4ALL local diversity effort, and attending inclusive teaching workshops at Brown’s Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning. <br/><br/>To help overcome the ill-posed problem of scene reconstruction from passive RGB cameras, this project has three areas of focus: 1) Investigate new camera systems that integrate multiple kinds of signals via physically based image formation models. Existing platforms handle typically one modality and frequency (visible light), but the project aims to combine visible light, time of flight, and event cameras to balance the negative effects of each camera and produce a signal of a quality that no individual camera could produce: high spatio-temporal resolution 3D video. 2) Investigate lighting and material decomposition via better capture, sampling, and reconstruction from heterogeneous omnidirectional cameras via new fast view synthesis methods adapted to represent incident illumination. This will use learned material priors from factorizations of physically based reflectance models that can exploit captured full and partial omnidirectional samples. 3) Investigate hybrid representations, optimization, and machine learning methods, including initialization based on reliable sparse sampling from depth sensors, via physically based self-supervised transforms to constrain optimization, and via residual error channels to allow the model to explain all that it can in a physically meaningful way and still train on real-world data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
153,Probing the Western Antarctic Lithosphere and Asthenosphere with New Approaches to Imaging Seismic Wave Attenuation and Velocity,"The western portion of the Antarctic continent is very active in terms of plate tectonic processes that can produce significant variations in the Earths mantle temperature as well as partial melting of the mantle. In addition to these internal processes, the ice sheet in western Antarctica is melting due to Earths warming climate and adding water to the ocean. These changes in ice mass cause adjustments in rocks within the Earth's crust, allowing the surface to rebound in some locations and fall in others, altering the geographical pattern of sea-level change. However, the solid Earth response depends strongly on the strength of the rocks at a wide range of timescales which is not well-known and varies with temperature and other rock properties. This project has three primary goals. (1) It will assess how processes such as rifting, mantle upwelling and lithospheric instability have altered the lithosphere and underlying asthenosphere of western Antarctica, contributing to a planet-wide understanding of these processes. (2) It will use new measurements of mantle and crust properties to estimate the rate at which heat from the solid Earth flows into the base of the ice, which is important for modeling the rates at which the ice melts and flows. (3) It will places bounds on mantle viscosity, which is key for modeling the interaction of the solid Earth with changing ice and water masses and their implications for sea-level rise. To accomplish these goals, new resolution of crust and mantle structure will be obtained by analyzing seismic waves from distant earthquakes that have been recorded at numerous seismic stations in Antarctica. These analyses will include new combinations of seismic wave data that provide complementary information about mantle temperature, heat flow and viscosity. This project will provide educational and career opportunities to a Brown University graduate student, undergraduates from groups underrepresented in science who will come to Brown University for a summer research program, and other undergraduates. The project will bring together faculty and students for a seminar at Brown that explores the connections between the solid Earth and ice processes in Antarctica. Project research will be incorporated in outreach to local public elementary schools and high schools.<br/> <br/>This research addresses key questions about mantle processes and properties in western Antarctica. What are the relative impacts of rifting, mantle plumes, and lithospheric delamination in the evolution of the lithosphere and asthenosphere? Where is topography isostatically compensated, and where are dynamic processes such as plate flexure or tractions from 3-D mantle flow required? What are the bounds on heat flow and mantle viscosity, which represent important inputs to models of ice sheet evolution and its feedback from the solid Earth? To address these questions, this project will measure mantle and crust properties using seismic tools that have not yet been applied in Antarctica: regional-scale measurement of mantle attenuation from surface waves; Sp body wave phases to image mantle velocity gradients such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary; and surface wave amplification and ellipticity. The resulting models of seismic attenuation and velocity will be jointly interpreted to shed new light on temperature, bulk composition, volatile content, and partial melt, using a range of laboratory-derived constitutive laws, while considering data from mantle xenoliths. To test the relative roles of rifting, mantle plumes, and delamination, and to assess isostatic support for Antarctic topography, the predictions of these processes will be compared to the new models of crust and mantle properties. To improve bounds on western Antarctic heat flow, seismic attenuation and velocity will be used in empirical comparisons and in direct modeling of vertical temperature gradients. To better measure mantle viscosity at the timescales of glacial isostatic adjustment, frequency-dependent viscosity will be estimated from the inferred mantle conditions. This project will contribute to the education and career development of the following: a Brown University Ph.D. student, Brown undergraduates, and undergraduates from outside the university will be involved through the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS) Leadership Alliance NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site which focuses on geoscience summer research experiences for underrepresented students. The project will be the basis for a seminar at Brown that explores the connections between the solid Earth and cryosphere in Antarctica and will contribute to outreach in local public elementary and high schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
154,Pedagogical Tools for Formal Methods,"In computer science, formal methods refer to mathematical approaches to make predictions about a software or hardware system. Formal methods play an increasingly vital role in developing secure and reliable systems. However, formal methods tend to be abstract and use methods and notations that are not part of many computing curricula. As a result, there is a need to research and develop approaches to effectively train cybersecurity students to use formal methods. The current proposal focuses on creating pedagogical tools centered around programming environments. The approach will be evaluated across a broad population, from college students to industrial programmers, to ensure the results will be as broadly applicable as possible. In addition, all products will be made freely available to other educators.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this project is to have subjects engage with formal methods tools to create, explore, reason about, and verify models. The focus will be on models related to security, such as cryptographic protocols, configuration, authentication, and access control. The project team proposes creating a series of graduated levels of formal languages to match a learning progression and reduce the learning load. This approach will enable students to use domain-specific notations to adopt formal methods within the context of domains they already study. Finally, it will enable students to create domain-specific custom visualizations that greatly reduce the cognitive gap between the output of a generic tool and the problems students want to solve. All these topics will be studied experimentally and evaluated to learn about what approaches are effective and what are not.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
155,Collaborative Research: Tracing the Missing Physics of Submesoscale Entrainment and Subduction,"This project will investigate the exchange between the well-mixed surface layer of the ocean and the stratified interior at the so-called submesoscales; horizontal length scales of hundreds to thousands of meters, where the rotation of the Earth is still felt but is not the dominant factor like it is at larger scales. This exchange is widely recognized as one of the primary mechanisms through which submesoscale processes affect upper ocean variability and biogeochemistry. However, despite extensive work demonstrating the impacts of submesoscale entrainment and subduction on diverse topics across the field of oceanography— including for example the global mixed-layer heat budget, primary productivity, and the export of carbon to the interior—the essential physical mechanisms remain incompletely described. In particular, next steps need to include the impact of the submesoscale interactions between the surface boundary layer and the interior on large-scale models, as parameterizations of submesoscale processes explicitly avoid entrainment fluxes. This avoidance severely underestimates submesoscale impacts on biogeochemistry and climate (e.g., long-term carbon and heat uptake). Recent work, some from this group, further indicates that cross-scale interactions between submesoscale flows, surface gravity waves, and turbulence may also significantly alter the exchange at the base of the surface mixed layer. However, the balance of several possible mechanisms for this exchange has not been established. This project will quantify the effect of these multiscale interactions using new theoretical and computational tools, resulting in more complete models of submesoscale exchange between the ocean interior and surface boundary layer. Advances for both climate-scale and high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation models will be shared with the science community. New techniques in tracer diagnostics and theory will be developed, and used to clarify the role of multiscale interactions in affecting exchange between the boundary layer and interior, providing guidance towards new approaches in multiscale numerical modeling, parameterization, and ocean observing. The majority of the funds for this project will go towards supporting early career scientists: a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher, an early career research scientist, and an early career faculty member.<br/><br/>Reynolds-averaged numerical simulations (RANS) will quantify the impact of incorporating entrainment fluxes into a widely utilized parameterization of submesoscale mixedlayer instability, including the impact of the improved parameterization on realistic simulations incorporating ocean biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean. Large-eddy simulations (LES) will determine the processes and parameter dependence through which submesoscale instabilities, surface gravity wave-driven effects such as Langmuir turbulence, and small-scale three-dimensional turbulence interact to modify entrainment and subduction of tracers. New insights into these multiscale interactions will be enabled by recent developments in boundary layer energetics, potential vorticity dynamics, and techniques for eddy-flux diagnostics developed as part of this project. These advances will be applied to a set of state-of-the-art large-domain LES that resolve scales of order 1 m to 10km, providing new benchmarks in exascale ocean modeling. Together these activities will simulate and quantify the essential mechanisms of entrainment and subduction at the submesoscale, their cross-scale interactions, and their accurate interpretation in observations and representation in numerical models. Community ocean and climate model improvements will be furthered through inclusion of improved and vetted representation of entrainment fluxes in two parameterizations, including the most widely used parameterization of submesoscale mixed-layer instability and a newer process parameterization. The LES that will be performed will be made available for immediate community use, providing a valuable new resource supporting other investigations into submesoscale-Langmuir-turbulence, and physical-biogeochemical interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
156,CAREER: CAS: Donor-Amplified Catalytic Approaches to Stereocontrolled Biodegradable Polymers,"This award is funded in whole or in part under the America Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Jerome Robinson of Brown University and his team of researchers are investigating new approaches to make biodegradable plastics (polymers) from inexpensive and abundant materials. Polymers have enabled critical advances in nearly every aspect of modern life; however, the majority end up in landfills and waterways and take generations to degrade in the environment. The development of sustainable substitutes has been limited by their higher cost and poorer properties compared to current environmentally persistent synthetic materials, and requires new approaches to address this challenge. Dr. Robinson’s team is developing innovative catalysts to be deployed in the construction of biodegradable polymers and to rigorously control their molecular structure and composition. The proposed research has significant broader societal impact, as such approaches could access scalable and affordable next-generation materials with improved properties and degradation profiles. Dr. Robinson and his team are also developing programs for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students that are designed to train and mentor a diverse STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce of the future. This includes the Rhode Island Sustainable Chemistry Partnerships (RI SCP) program that will create opportunities to directly integrate chemistry research into Rhode Island public high school experiences. Additional educational and outreach programs aim to enhance educational equity for students throughout the region, including improved access to early-stage research experiences and career professional development.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Jerome Robinson of Brown University and his team of researchers are developing donor-amplified catalytic approaches to stereocontrolled biodegradable polymers. Modulation of dynamic exchange processes between labile exogeneous donors and catalysts can dramatically enhance performance in asymmetric catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis, yet such approaches have received limited attention in the synthesis of biodegradable polymers. Mechanistically driven experimental and theoretical studies from the Robinson group are expected to advance the fundamental understanding of how donor effects can be exploited to tune catalyst performance in stereospecific ring-opening polymerization (ROP). This is expected to enable stereocontrolled access to biodegradable polymers, including those derived from monomers that themselves emanate from inexpensive and abundant feedstocks. This chemistry should lead to scalable and sustainable alternatives to traditional, high-volume, and environmentally persistent materials. Dr. Robinson’s research goals are strongly integrated with educational objectives focused on training and mentoring a diverse STEM workforce. This includes sustainable classroom and research partnerships with public high schools in Rhode Island, early-stage research experiences for high school and undergraduate students, and enhanced student access to career professional development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
157,"Nanosheet-Biomolecular Hybrid Films Synthesis, Structure, and Controlled Release","Two-dimensional materials are a broad class of atomically thin, sheet-like solids with novel properties. These two-dimensional materials, or “nanosheets”, can be stacked together in various configurations to make macroscopic materials with internal layered structures. Such macroscopic layered materials find use in emerging technologies that include textile barrier layers for personal protective equipment, coatings to stabilize or protect surfaces, drug delivery patches and implantable biomaterials. This project seeks to enhance the functions of these layered materials by incorporating biologically active molecules to make hybrids. A major focus is to measure and predict the rates at which those imbedded biomolecules are released, and become active and functional on the outer surfaces and nearby fluid phases. This controlled release can be used to create long-lifetime antibacterial and antiviral coatings for surfaces, textile layers that release insect repellants, or biomaterials that provide timed delivery of drugs. The research will identify methods for controlling the release rate and thus controlling the active lifetime of these devices by manipulating the methods of synthesis and processing. The research team will also be engaged in activities that motivate and prepare underrepresented groups for studies and careers in engineering and science. The principal investigators will collaborate with societies promoting engineering career choices and advancement for women, Hispanics, and Native Americans and will host a Rhode Island Science Day event featuring tours, demonstrations and hands-on activities for upper elementary and middle school tribal youth in the state to introduce and promote opportunities in science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will create, characterize and apply a new set of hetero-structured layered materials with active biomolecular species intercalated in the van der Waals gaps between stacked two-dimensional nanosheets. These frontier hybrids combine the novel properties of atomically-thin nanosheets with the targeted, chemically specific functions of biomolecules. The project will pursue the hypothesis that molecular release kinetics are governed by internal transport processes involving molecular diffusion through nanochannels. Nanochannel transport phenomena are poorly understood, as are the implications for the timing, location, and direction of molecular release from films or macroscopic layered monoliths. The research plan has three Objectives: (1) to synthesize and characterize a panel of hybrid layered materials; (2) to measure biomolecular release kinetics and elucidate release mechanisms to identify design strategies for control; and (3) to demonstrate multifunctional 2D hybrid devices and characterize their dynamic expression of biochemical surface activity in case studies focused on antibacterial and antiviral function. Scientific outputs from this project will include a suite of new hybrid materials with information on their structures and properties, the first quantitative models for release rate prediction and control, and values of nanochannel diffusion coefficients for a range of molecules obtained by model-based extraction from molecular release rate data. The investigator team will also engage in educational outreach to motivate and prepare students from underrepresented groups for studies and careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
158,"The Transition from Back Arc to Slab Window to Continental Rifting, Evidence from the Subcontinental Lithospheric Mantle of West Antarctica","The subcontinental mantle lithosphere is created and modified at plate boundaries through a complex and variable mix of tectonic and magmatic processes that ultimately affect the evolution of the Earth's continents and mantle. The project goal is to evaluate the processes that create, modify, and destroy the subcontinental mantle lithosphere beneath Western Antarctica through the interpretation of a well-integrated set of geochemical and microstructural data from rock samples. The new data will be integrated with already existing seismological observations and geochemistry of erupted basalts. The project will estimate how the composition, structure, mechanical properties, temperature, and foundering potential of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere change along a transect through the Antarctic Peninsula, Jones Mountain, Marie Byrd Land and Ross Island; areas that represent different tectonic and magmatic conditions. <br/><br/>This project assesses the geochemistry and microstructure on mantle xenoliths collected in West Antarctica to establish: 1) the xenolith pressure-temperature conditions of the tectono-magmatic events, 2) the variations in the degree of mantle hydration in time and space and its effect on the associated microstructure, 3) the time and source of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere metasomatic agents, 4) the link between mantle xenolith data and the already existing seismological observations and geochemistry of erupted basalts, 5) the effective viscosity of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere and whether the deformation occurred prior to or was affected by the introduction of water and melt, and 6) the contribution of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere into the composition of the erupted basalts across West Antarctica. A key question the project will address is how normal subduction, slab window and continental rifting have produced differences in the inferred density and viscosity structures; and how such difference affected the stability of the subcontinental mantle lithosphere and its potential for ablation by mantle wedge flow, aided by reductions in viscosity due to volatiles and melt, and/or foundering beneath West Antarctica.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
159,Collaborative Research: Labor Market and Public Policy Preferences,"What people want (preferences) is central to economic analysis and policy formulation. Yet there is no easy or generally acceptable way of measuring preferences from data. The proposed research develops a portable, scalable, and easy to measure preference revelation (elicitation) method called the Bayesian Adaptive Choice Experiment (BACE). BACE improves upon existing preference elicitation approaches that are used in policy analysis, regulation, and litigation. The method will be applied to study important and policy-relevant questions: (i) preferences for job amenities such as workplace flexibility, and firm provision of such amenities---important considerations in the face of global technical and organizational changes. This is important as global technical and organizational changes have the potential to alter the structure of work as the costs of providing workplace amenities shift over time. (ii) in preferences for public policies, the research produces method of comparing the welfare benefits of various policies for different demographic groups. In addition to these applications, BACE shows the potential for a new generation of surveys and experimental methods to do much more in helping researchers and policymakers value non-market resources. The results of this research will contribute significantly to improve economic analyses as well as improve the quality of public policies and business decisions and thus increase economic growth. <br/><br/>BACE provides an efficient dynamic elicitation procedure for conducting choice experiments. It does so by generating the information-maximizing sequence of choice scenarios based on a prior that gets updated with previous answers to obtain individual-level Bayesian posterior estimates. The procedure allows for a higher precision of the parameter estimates with fewer choice scenarios presented to each subject while also overcoming systematic biases in estimating average preference parameters from commonly used static approaches. Applying the method to preferences for job amenities, the resulting individual-level preference data makes it possible to estimate a new model of compensating differentials that extends the classic Rosen (1986) framework. Applying BACE to willingness to pay for public policies produces new evidence on the correlates of policy preferences and leads to novel estimates of the Marginal Value of Public Funds. The implementation of BACE in this research is a step forward in allowing such procedures to be widely adopted to measure important inputs for understanding a broad range of phenomena in social sciences. The results of this research will contribute significantly to improve economic analyses as well as improve the quality of public policies and business decisions and thus increase economic growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

161,REU Site: Biology of Animal Movement and Performance,"This REU Site award to Brown University, located in Providence, RI, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2022-2024. It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and minority-serving institutions (MSIs) will be trained in the program. Recruitment will occur in partnership with The Leadership Alliance, a consortium of approximately 35 academic institutions and partners across the US that seeks to both train and mentor underrepresented minority students in summer research programs, while providing continuous support for careers in academia and research.

Mentors are scientists at Brown University who are closely affiliated with the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology, and who study the causes and consequences of movement in a wide range of animal taxa. Students will therefore engage in projects that explore the biophysics of movement, physiological control of movement, function of movement, and significance of movement for evolution. Training in these areas of research will emphasize computational approaches to data analysis, whether through bioinformatics, modeling, or other forms of large-scale data analytics. Students will also engage in outreach efforts by working in local preschools to teach young children about animal diversity. Recruitment will occur in partnership with The Leadership Alliance, and applications will be evaluated by a small selection committee of Brown faculty who are also mentors in the program. Preference will be given to applicants who show a strong desire for training in integrative biology.

162,Collaborative Research: Decoding thermal and magmatic history of mafic and ultramafic rocks through systematic studies of cation diffusion in pyroxene,"Orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene are two major rock-forming minerals in the Earth’s upper mantle and lower crust. Major and trace element compositions of the pyroxenes have been widely used to infer thermal and magmatic histories experienced by pyroxene-bearing rocks. A common feature of pyroxene in natural rocks is the presence of exsolution lamellae. There is no model for cation diffusion in and through pyroxene in the presence of exsolution lamellae, which hinders the interpretation of thermal history of pyroxene-bearing rocks. The focus of this collaborative study is Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene. The project consists of three main tasks: (1) theoretical and numerical studies of the role of exsolution lamellae on cation diffusion in pyroxene; (2) experimental studies of Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene; and (3) geochemical applications. The outcome shall be a set of models for diffusive mass transfer across pyroxene grains that have exsolution lamellae. These diffusion models are general and can also be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials outside the field of petrology and geochemistry. Al, Ca, Zr and Hf diffusion coefficients will then be applied to develop generalized mass transfer models that can be used to quantify rare earth element (REE) and high-field strength element (HFSE) fractionation during disequilibrium melting along a mantle adiabat followed by subsolidus re-equilibration. New models for closure temperatures of the Ca-in-opx thermometer and the Al-in-opx thermometer will be developed. These new models will be used to study the distribution and fractionation of REE and HFSE in pyroxenes in peridotites from different tectonic settings. The broader impacts of the proposed work will focus on graduate and undergraduate training and support of a highly productive female scientist. Models for diffusion in and through laminates to be developed in this proposed work are general and can be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials in fields outside Earth science. <br/><br/>Major and trace element zoning in pyroxene has often been observed in mafic and ultramafic rocks, which may provide important clues to the thermal and magmatic histories experienced by the pyroxene-bearing rocks. A common feature of pyroxene in natural rocks is the presence of exsolution lamellae. Although significant progress has been made in quantifying rare earth element (REE) and high field strength element (HFSE) diffusion in pyroxene, very little is known about Al diffusion in pyroxene. There are no published data for Ca diffusion in orthopyroxene and no model for cation diffusion in and through pyroxene in the presence of exsolution lamellae. The focus of this collaborative study is Al, Ca and HFSE diffusion and distribution in pyroxene and their geochemical applications. The project consists of three main Tasks: (1) theoretical and numerical studies of the role of exsolution lamellae on cation diffusion in pyroxene; (2) experimental studies of Al, Ca, Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene; and (3) geochemical applications. The majority of the diffusion experiments will be conducted at 1-atm pressure. The potential effects of pressure on Al, Ca Zr, and Hf diffusion in pyroxene are not known, but some higher-pressure experiments will be conducted. Diffusion profiles of Al in experimental charges will be measured with the 27Al(p,gamma)28Si nuclear reaction. Diffusion profiles of Ca, Zr and Hf will be measured with Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry. The outcome of Task 1 is a set of microscale and macroscale models for diffusive mass transfer across pyroxene grains that have exsolution lamellae. These diffusion models are general and can also be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials outside the field of petrology and geochemistry. Together with published partitioning and diffusion data, Al, Ca, Zr and Hf diffusion coefficients from Task 2 will be used to develop generalized mass transfer models that can be used to quantify REE and HFSE fractionation during disequilibrium melting along a mantle adiabat followed by subsolidus re-equilibration. As part of Task 3, new models for closure temperatures of the Ca-in-opx thermometer and the Al-in-opx thermometer will be developed. These new models will be used to study the distribution and fractionation of REE and HFSE in pyroxenes in peridotites from different tectonic settings. The broader impacts of the proposed work will focus on human resources, which include graduate and undergraduate training and support of a highly productive female scientist. The proposed work will constitute a major part of the graduate student’s PhD thesis. The project will provide laboratory analytical and computer modeling experiences for undergraduate students and research opportunities for senior thesis projects. Models for diffusion in and through laminates to be developed in this proposed work are general and can be used to study chemical and mechanic properties of composite materials in fields outside Earth science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
163,CAREER: studying superconductivity and ferromagnetism in 2D material heterostructures with flat energy band,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/>Two-dimensional (2D) materials are materials made from single layers of atoms. Different 2D materials can be assembled into a designer structure to realize new properties and novel phenomena such as superconductivity and magnetism. This project utilizes a special design of 2D structure to study how electronic interaction can influence the stability of these novel phenomena, such as superconductivity and magnetism, in the quantum regime. Studying these phenomena on the nanometer scale is central to the advancement of quantum science, which promises to reshape the nature of technological innovation and has profound influence on national security and global economic balance. By training graduate and undergraduate students in device fabrication on a nanometer scale and exposing them to cutting edge research in studying quantum phenomena, this research and outreach program inspires and educates future scientists and engineers who can take on the leadership role and pioneer innovations in the field of quantum computational technology. The outreach effort includes collaboration with the Sci-Toon team to produce cartoon videos to expose the general public to the research activities. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: <br/>Graphene moiré systems provides a fascinating material platform to study quantum phenomena, such as superconductivity and ferromagnetism, and investigate their interplay in a 2D confinement. This project utilizes specially designed 2D material heterostructure, which is usually referred to as the double-layer structure, to perform Coulomb screening and thermodynamic measurements on various moiré systems. A main objective is to understand the role of Coulomb correlation in stabilizing the superconducting and ferromagnetic phases. The role of Coulomb interaction offers important constraints to understand the pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry of the superconducting phase, which has become an outstanding open question. This project also explores a new flavor of moiré physics using the proximity effect, which are shown to transform the ground state order of 2D moiré systems. By controlling the strength of Coulomb interaction through screening, the proposed effort directly studies the influence of the proximity effect and aims to establish a new method to engineer physical properties of 2D material structures. This project is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
164,CAREER: Molecular Resolution of Long-range Allostery in CRISPR-Cas9,"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/><br/>CRISPR-Cas9 represents a transformative biomolecular tool with potential to impact laboratory science, bioengineering, and precision medicine. The large, multidomain Cas9 protein at the heart of this technology is governed by an intricate signaling mechanism that guides the targeted cleavage of DNA. However, many of the underlying details of the Cas9 mechanism are poorly understood at the molecular level, hampering the development of intuitive chemical tools that leverage its cutting-edge functional potential. The project will study Cas9 at the atomic level to establish how this protein transmits chemical information throughout its complex structure to affect biological function, which has been proposed as a major driving force for this system. Such insight will lead to the development of CRISPR-Cas9 proteins with enhanced spatial and temporal specificity. This project will create interactive learning experiences to teach protein structure-function relationships to graduate, undergraduate, and predominantly underrepresented Providence High School students. American Rescue Plan funding is used to support this early career investigator at a critical stage in his career. <br/><br/>The project will integrate solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular simulations, in vitro and in vivo biochemistry to further our understanding of molecular crosstalk in Cas9 that is proposed to drive an intricate allosteric mechanism. Efforts to establish this mechanism are attractive for developing enhanced Cas9 variants, since allosteric regulation provides superior spatial and temporal control over protein function, both of which currently hamper Cas9 applications. The project will dissect allosteric pathways through the analysis of differential motions probed by NMR spin relaxation and computational network analysis to map the specific amino acids and interactions responsible for transmitting structural or dynamic changes that facilitate DNA cleavage. The contribution of intrinsic protein dynamics to allostery has been increasingly studied to rationalize the role of amino acid “pathways” that facilitate communication through multidomain protein structures. Specifically, the project will elucidate the pathway(s) of allosteric signaling coupling distant Cas9 domains, determine how allosteric networks rewire upon ligand binding, characterize the effects of activity or specificity-altering mutations on allosteric signaling, and establish biophysical comparisons between mesophilic and thermophilic Cas9 species. Further avenues toward residue-level deconvolution of the MIF and Cas9 allosteric networks are proposed and required to refine and engineer spatial or temporal control into these systems more intuitively. This project is funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
165,EAGER: Collaborative Research: Enhancing Asian American and Pacific Islander Participation and Belonging in the Geosciences,"Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) represent one of the fastest growing demographics in the U.S. today and yet lag in participation and representation in geoscience graduate programs compared to other STEM fields. Thus, new programs are needed that specifically recruit AAPI STEM undergraduates to geoscience graduate programs and enhance belonging of AAPI geoscientists as a whole. The proposed activities will focus on Minority Serving institutions (MSIs) that serve AAPI. This project will expose as many as 1,000 undergraduates from MSIs in geoscience-adjacent STEM fields to geoscience research and careers, provide a new research internship opportunity and create national cross-career stage connections between AAPI geoscientists to produce a cohort of geoscience leaders from a group often left out of diversity discussions. AAPI scientists desire to relate their work to local populations and problems relevant to their communities; therefore, diversifying geoscience graduate programs with those identifying as AAPI will have a direct impact on communities facing important geoscience problems of the 21st century such as climate change, natural hazards, and resource scarcity.<br/><br/>This project supports pilot programs to enhance participation and belonging for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities in geosciences. The proposed activities include: 1) Establishing a researcher visit program to recruit undergraduate AAPI into geosciences via visits to AAPI-serving MSIs from geoscience researchers; 2) A pilot research internship program for undergraduates at these institutions to carry out research with AAPI mentors; 3) Organizing virtual and in-person events and a career development workshop to enhance belonging, identity, and leadership within the AAPI geoscience community across career stages and sectors. The outcomes of this combination of the proposed activities will help to develop geoscience programs, and create a cohort and community of Belonging, Access, Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (BAJEDI) leaders of AAPI geoscientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
166,III: Medium: Collaborative Research: Situated Visual Information Spaces,"The aim of this project is to enable people to effectively visualize information about the world in augmented reality. Augmented reality is potentially the next big social benefit from computer technologies, because it allows visual information to be embedded - or ‘situated’ - into the real world. This allows people using smartphones and smartglasses to see data around them in the correct real-world context. However, unlike when visualizing data on a regular computer or smartphone display, where a designer has complete control over how the application looks and feels, augmented reality visualizations are inherently overlaid on the real world. As such, visualizations must be capable of reacting to different real-world environments including dynamic scenes, and for there to be design recommendations that say how visualizations should react to different environments. This project will scientifically investigate visualization for augmented reality, study the efficacy of different approaches, create design recommendations, and then build a software system that can apply these recommendations to help design and run effective visualization applications. The proposed approach will be experimentally validated in the sports and healthcare domains.<br/><br/>Situated visual information spaces fuse the digital information world with the physical world of objects, people, locations, and environments using augmented reality. To realize this, three scientific and design challenges will be tackled: (1) Situated visualization, interaction, and collaboration, which requires intuitive in-situ data visualizations, physical and digital interfaces for natural user interactions, and schemes for collaboration in augmented reality. Novel situated visual embedding methods will be studied for spatial and non-spatial data in dynamic environmental and situational contexts. These visualizations will automatically adapt to the physical environment, digital entities, users, and tasks while using perceptually and cognitively effective methods that do not overwhelm the user. (2) Design via constraints, where software reduces the increased complexity of creating visualizations that adapt to real-world environments. This software is aimed at visualization designers and evaluates guidelines as constraints, then balances these to provide recommendations for appropriate data and designs for the current environment. (3) Situated applications, where two wellness applications in healthcare and sports will be developed and evaluated in partnership with respective domain experts. Within them, these domains cover a spectrum of different techniques, tasks, and users. These applications will help to define an achievable research scope, drive it with motivated stakeholders, and present best-practices via use cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
167,Personalizing Math Instruction at Scale: A Meta-Analytic and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Math Tutoring Programs,"This project will identify the most cost-effective and scalable methods of delivering mathematics tutoring to K-12 public school students for the purpose of accelerating learning. While there is a notably large body of rigorous research documenting that high-dosage tutoring produces large academic gains for children who have fallen behind academically, less is known about the features of effective programs needed to guide program design. Additionally, the widespread adoption of tutoring programs has been hampered by the high upfront costs of intensive individualized instructional programs. This project will therefore isolate the key features of the most effective tutoring programs and the costs associated with these programs to identify program models with the potential to deliver the greatest benefits at the lowest cost. Program features could relate to tutor characteristics, the dosage of tutoring delivered, the timing of tutoring sessions, the training and support provided to tutors, tutor-student ratios, the content of tutoring sessions, and more. The project is particularly timely given policymakers and educators are currently looking to invest in affordable strategies to support students’ learning in mathematics given early evidence that Covid-19-related educational disruptions have negatively affected mathematics achievement. This project is funded by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances fundamental research on STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The project will include a thorough meta-analysis of all existing studies of mathematics tutoring interventions that use quasi-experimental or experimental methods designed to isolate the causal effects of the tutoring program in question. More specifically, the research team will search for, collect, and code all studies based on the features of the intervention under examination, the size of the effects the intervention had on student outcomes, as well as information that will allow them to calculate costs for each intervention. Researchers will then pool estimates across studies to identify the average effects of mathematics tutoring on student achievement and average per-pupil costs and to examine how the effects and costs of tutoring programs vary by design and program features. Finally, the researchers will examine which features of interventions predict the largest academic gains for students and calculate cost-benefit ratios for each intervention. Meta-analytic and cost-effectiveness reviews are a critical step in developing new scientific knowledge by generating conclusions with greater precision and external validity and accounting for publication bias which can skew perceptions about the overall effectiveness of an intervention when only well-known or successful programs are highlighted in the literature. This project will provide a comprehensive review across all existing studies, ultimately allowing the research team to accurately identify those mathematics tutoring models with the greatest promise for both impact and scalability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
168,CAREER: Existence and Regularity of Solutions to Variational Problems in Geometric Analysis,"This project studies optimization questions in geometric analysis, namely constructs that optimize energy or area subject to a constraint. Existence and structural results are of interest in areas such as engineering, physics, and chemistry. Classical examples are minimal surfaces, which locally minimize area subject to fixed boundary conditions, such as soap films supported by wires of various shapes. This project studies constant mean curvature (CMC) and minimal surfaces as well as harmonic maps. CMC surfaces optimize area, but with constraint given by enclosed volume -- CMC surfaces appear in nature as soap bubbles. Harmonic maps optimize energy rather than area and are closely related to minimal surfaces. The objects studied in this project have characterizations in many branches of mathematics; the questions and desired results are of broad interest in mathematics and beyond.<br/><br/>This research project primarily studies CMC surfaces immersed in smooth manifolds and harmonic maps into metric spaces. In the work on harmonic maps, the project aims to provide a new direction for resolution of Cannon's conjecture. It is planned to establish the existence of a harmonic homeomorphism from the round unit sphere into a sphere with a metric possessing upper curvature bounds. In a second direction, the project aims to refine techniques that produced a compactness theory for harmonic maps into metric spaces with upper curvature bounds. While the techniques for proving compactness in this setting are necessarily geometric and variational (rather than analytic), the results are analogous to those that establish compactness in the smooth setting. Using the refined techniques, the investigator plans to establish a harmonic replacement argument using energy rather than modulus of continuity methods. Other research directions relate to the study of CMC surfaces. The investigator plans to extend and refine a gluing construction that produced CMC hypersurfaces in Euclidean space. The new construction is expected to produce non-rotational, toroidal drops in Euclidean space and will serve as a model for a subsequent construction to produce CMC tori in three-manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
169,Collaborative Research: Emergent motor timing influences perceptual learning,"Many real-world behaviors, such as tapping to a musical beat, throwing a ball, or crossing the street, depend on precise timing among perception, cognition, and motor action. Luckily, our motor systems usually operate seamlessly in concert with our perceptual and cognitive processes. Despite how they work together in the real world, these aspects of behavior have been largely studied separately in the laboratory. While that approach allows scientific rigor and has provided significant insights into each subsystem, it says little about their interaction, which may be fundamental to understanding human behavior. A better understanding of how the temporal aspects of perceptual, cognitive, and motor behaviors are interrelated also has the potential to advance technological innovations, e.g., in cognitive neural prosthetics, a novel human-computer interface for helping paralyzed patients and patients with amputations. Identifying the temporal interactions among cognitive, perceptual, and motor functions has other translational potential for developing new rehabilitation paradigms for populations with impaired motor and perceptual timing. <br/><br/>This research program aims to evaluate whether and how timing in perception and motor control involves shared mechanisms that ensure seamless integration and plastic co-modification. The experimental approach combines a motor skill, throwing a ball in an augmented reality environment, with a time perception task. Objective 1 explores how motor timing that emerges from discrete throwing actions modifies perceptual timing. Objective 2 extends this question to situations requiring rhythmic throwing actions. Objective 3 examines whether learned coupling of motor and perceptual timing persists in the longer term. Taken together, this quantitative approach to understanding the connections between perceptual and motor timing will contribute to developing a unified theory of timing control in real-world contexts. The female investigator team has also identified multiple outreach activities to foster and communicate the integration of scientific research and STEM education and to increase minority representation in the cognitive, perceptual, and motor sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
170,Collaborative Research: Ice Forcing in Arc Magma Plumbing Systems (IF-AMPS),"This award is funded in whole or in part under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2).<br/>A question at the frontier of Earth science is: how do changes in the climate system on our planet's surface interact with magma reservoirs housed within its interior? We will conduct a novel blend of field observations, lab measurements, and numerical model simulations in an integrated study of links between changes in glaciers and topography, and the behavior of several active volcanoes in Chile during the last 50,000 years. These volcanoes were partly covered by the 3,000 foot thick Patagonian ice sheet until it melted rapidly beginning 18,000 years ago. This natural laboratory offers unparalleled means to investigate how the rapid loss of ice impacted the composition and rates of eruptions from these volcanoes. This project will provide career-building experience for several PhD students. A volcano & ice Summer program will engage technical school students from underrepresented groups in the US and Chile in field- and lab-based experiences, including training in drone technology for data collection and geologic mapping. Our collaborations with Chilean scientists and educators aim to: (1) enhance knowledge of the growth rates and eruptive histories of several of the most dangerous volcanoes in South America, thereby improving hazard assessment, (2) generate new climate proxy data critical to calibrating our numerical model of ice sheet retreat, and (3) train students from the communities living near these volcanoes.<br/>Utilizing new and existing geochronologic, geochemical, glacial and erosion/deposition observations within the Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, we aim to couple a suite of numerical models to test and refine three hypotheses: (1) Over short timescales (<100,000 year), the composition, volume, and timing of eruptions are strongly influenced by climate-driven changes in surface loading. These short-term responses modulate the long-term (>100,000 year) average eruptive characteristics, which are governed by mantle melt flux, (2) Crustal stress changes associated with the local onset of rapid deglaciation and erosion at 18,000 years ago promoted eruptions by enhancing volatile exsolution that in turn pressurized stored magma and propelled dike propagation to the surface, and (3) Responses to rapid unloading will vary among volcanoes, reflecting contrasts in the composition, volatile contents, and compressibility of stored magma, as well as the rate at which crustal reservoirs are recharged from depth. This variability can be exploited to reveal fundamental controls on the sensitivity of glaciated arcs to the climate system. To investigate these hypotheses, we will pursue four objectives: (1) Generate high-resolution records of cone growth, eruptive behavior, and geochemical evolution of six volcanoes during the last ~50,000 years spanning 250 km along the subduction zone, (2) Build new records of ice retreat, and landscape evolution owing to the erosion, transport, and deposition of sediment adjacent to the six volcanoes, (3) Use the observed chemical and physical patterns in the volcanic, climatic, and topographic records to constrain crustal loading through time, and explore the effects of this forcing in numerical models, and (4) Integrate findings to contextualize processes in continental settings, and provide a framework for examining the sensitivity of arc volcanism to external forcing elsewhere and across a spectrum of climate states throughout Earth history.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of the resulting distorted, magnified, multiple images of the background galaxy provide clues to the nature of dark matter. The principal investigators (PIs) Gleyzer, Ames and Alexander will develop the Strong Lensing Inference and Generative System for Harnessing Observational Telescope Data (SLINGSHOT) framework for simulating realistic gravitational lensing images and applying machine learning algorithms to identify known categories of possible dark matter substructure. The PIs will broaden participation with a series of online lectures on machine learning and astrophysics as part of the National Society of Black Physicists Computational Physics Initiative. The team will also continue to teach data science concepts with Jupyter notebooks through their Creative Open Data Environment (CODER) education and outreach project for K-12 teachers and students.<br/><br/>The PIs will establish a baseline for classification of dark matter substructure morphology using both conventional (Bayesian) and machine learning algorithms. They will train the machine learning algorithms in anomaly detection, classification and property estimation using a library of representative dark matter models. Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques will identify promising candidate images in a model-independent manner and localize anomalies for further analysis. The PIs will use the code to analyze gravitational lensing data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope, in preparation to apply their methods to survey data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

172,Collaborative Research: P2C2--Western United States Hydroclimate during the Last Interglacial: Developing Proxy Records and Using Model Intercomparison to Glimpse the Future,"Freshwater availability is critical to agricultural, energy and urban systems in the arid to semi-arid western U.S. Quantifying hydroclimate change during past warm periods, such as the Last Interglacial (LIG; ~129,000-116,000 years before present), is essential for evaluating climate model simulations of Earth’s past. This project aims to reconstruct variations in the spatial and seasonal distribution of precipitation in the western U.S. during the LIG during which global temperature are comparable to low-end 21st century projections. The project will include the application of novel methods (calcium and triple oxygen isotopes) on stalagmites from Lake Shasta Caverns (northern California) and Titan Cave (northern Wyoming), and will provide new chronological data and novel measurements (carbonate clumped and triple oxygen isotopes) at four lake sites in the northeast Great Basin (Bear Lake, Utah/Idaho and Bonneville Basin, Utah/Nevada), and southwest Great Basin/Mojave Desert (Lake Manix and Owens Lake, California). The anticipated results of this project are past records of changes in temperature, rainfall amount and moisture source and seasonality. These new past climate records will be integrated into a regional proxy-data network used to benchmark climate model simulations of the Last Interglacial period (127 ka).<br/><br/>The paleoclimate modeling intercomparison (PMIP4) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) efforts of the climate modeling community include Tier 1 LIG (127ka) simulations as a benchmarking target for models with similar CO2 levels, different orbital configuration, unchanged topography and higher sea level. The validation of hydroclimate-relevant variables at a regional scale using climate models requires robustly dated and spatially distributed paleoclimate observations in order to place the LIG water cycle in the western U.S. in the context of geologic and future climate change. Yet, few quantitative estimates of paleoclimate exist for this interval, which offers geochronologic challenges too as it is beyond the limit of radiocarbon age control. This project seeks to improve our understanding of LIG climate in the western U.S. by providing: 1) new observations from speleothem records, 2) new U-Th dating of existing lake cores, and 3) the application of novel semi-quantitative proxies for temperature, precipitation and humidity to speleothems and lake sediments. Through the development of new high-resolution proxy time-series from speleothems and lake sediments, we will provide new insight into the behavior of the North American Monsoon during a past warm period and reconstruct hydroclimatic response to abrupt climatic events during the penultimate deglaciation (Termination II) and Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS5). The research uses existing lake cores recovered and archived by previous NSF- and USGS-funded continental drilling projects, and recently collected speleothems known to span much of MIS5 and the LIG.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include quantifying regional hydroclimate changes during past warm periods and benchmarking of climate model simulations for the last interglacial. Other Broader Impacts include translating the project research outcomes via a workshop (paleo to policy) convening water resource managers, government agencies (e.g., USGS), climate and weather risk assessment and projection companies and early career paleoclimate researchers from across the U.S. This workshop will emphasize on the information that terrestrial past climate records (lake sediments, tree rings, speleothems) can provide in terms of hydroclimate data beyond the instrumental records needed by policy makers to assess climate variability and extreme events such as drought and floods. The researchers will produce a white paper, policy briefs for water resource managers and a presentation at an education and outreach session at a scientific meeting (American Geophysical Union). The project will provide scientific training, mentorship and professional development for two graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher. Through joint field trips and collaborations, these students and postdoc will have opportunities to develop interdisciplinary expertise in climate archives, novel proxy systems, geochronology and model-proxy comparison. In addition, the researchers will recruit undergraduate students to complete summer internships related to the project. The undergraduate students will be recruited through (1) the Earth Horizons program and partnership between Vanderbilt University and Tennessee State University, a Historically Black University (HBCU); (2) the Leadership Alliance program at Brown University funded through NSF-REU-EPSCOR. The undergraduate students will be encouraged to develop their research into presentations at regional, national and international scientific meetings (e.g., AGU, GSA).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
173,RTG: Mathematics of Information and Data with Applications to Science,"The big-data revolution has transformed many areas of engineering, industry, mathematics, and science. For instance, data generated through genome-wide association studies, observations from telescopes, and computational simulations on petaflop computers provide tremendous opportunities to better understand the world around us. These massive datasets also pose many challenges, and there has been an explosion of research in recent years about how to manipulate, store, and extract meaningful information from ever-larger amounts of data. Mathematical analysis, algorithms, and insights have been and will continue to be a crucial component of this research effort. This RTG project will focus on the mathematical foundations and applications of data science and will catalyze research collaborations that combine different mathematical perspectives to address emerging challenges and opportunities. The mathematical challenges of data science also present a unique and transformative opportunity to develop more systematic and integrated training for the next generation; the project will broaden and enhance the scope and quality of the educational and research training provided to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and will involve more undergraduate students, particularly students from historically underrepresented groups, in courses and research experiences in applied mathematics, increasing the workforce trained in data science.<br/><br/>The project focuses on research and training in the mathematical foundations of data science and its applications. The research projects have strong interdisciplinary flavor, combining fundamental stochastic, statistical, combinatorial, dynamical, and computational aspects with concrete applications. Projects will involve collaborations with domain scientists from other disciplines, including astrophysics, biology, engineering, and neuroscience. Topics will include applying machine learning and Bayesian statistics tools to deriving, analyzing, and simulating partial differential equations; designing optimal closed-loop experiments using statistical inference; advancing techniques in discrete optimization; developing combinatorial models in neuroscience; understanding random projections of high-dimensional measures; and constructing dimension reduction techniques that preserve relevant structure of large data sets. The educational activities focus on vertically integrated training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. Training activities include a first-year seminar focused on the interface of data and social justice, enhanced undergraduate and graduate curricula, summer research experiences for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, and working groups for advanced graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The broader impacts include the recruitment, retention, and training of a diverse cohort of applied mathematicians trained in data science. In addition, the research planned in genome-wide association studies, design of closed-loop neuroscience experiments, single-cell data alignment, image restoration, simulation of Hubble data, self-assembly, inference of dynamical brain data, and data compression and reduction aims to have impact in applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
174,CAREER: Experimental tests of competition and facilitation among migratory large herbivores from Yellowstone National Park,"A big question in ecology is: “who eats what?” Biologists need answers to this question in order to know how food webs are structured. This knowledge is what enables us to understand where species live, how they behave, and whether any disturbances to the system are liable to have adverse effects on the valuable services that nature provides to people. Yet despite working to answer this question for more than a century, researchers still struggle to identify all of the feeding links that together create the food webs of ecosystems around the world. This project focuses on the food web of Yellowstone National Park in order to understand how the diets of bison and other large mammalian herbivores are able to sustain their epic annual migrations across the ecosystem. In a collaboration with the National Park Service, undergraduates and early career researchers will track the migrations of five iconic species, monitor their foraging behaviors, and develop new types of molecular biomarkers that will enable biologists to measure animal nutrition in the wild. This CAREER project integrates real-world and classroom-based learning objectives that will advance the training of a diverse workforce capable of implementing the types of rapid diagnostic tests that are essential in modern environmental science, healthcare, and epidemiology.<br/><br/>The research team will evaluate competing hypotheses about how seasonal changes in plant diversity and availability alter the diets of five co-occurring herbivore species: bison, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, and pronghorn antelope. A combination of field observations and experiments, fecal DNA metabarcoding, and an innovative adaptation of CRISPR technology for the analysis of animal nutrition will reveal: (i) how variation in animal diets feeds back to influence the structure and composition of vegetation and (ii) how different herbivore species stimulate the production of their own preferred food plants compared to the food plants preferred by other herbivores. Results will be used to parameterize a generalizable nutritional model in order to identify competition and facilitation operating in the food web. By developing, testing, and employing novel laboratory methods in combination with a series of time-tested experimental strategies in field ecology, the team aims to overcome the long-standing challenge of precisely characterizing trophic interactions in many research and training programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
175,Collaborative Research: 21 cm Reionization Science with the MWA,"The Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is the period of time in the early Universe when it is thought that the first stars and galaxies formed. Understanding the physics of galaxy formation and feedback during the EoR is one of the key goals of modern cosmology and astrophysics. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the early Universe have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of these first stars and galaxies. This work will improve data analysis with the Murchison Widefield Array telescope so that researchers can make significantly better detections of such faint signals, making the observations much more useful and providing a tool for researchers engaged in similar projects. In addition, this work will continue and expand the initiative to provide Research Experiences for Non-Traditional Undergraduates. Undergraduate research is an essential component in preparing students both for graduate school and for positions in the broader STEM workforce. Providing this kind of research experience to non-traditional undergraduate students will enable more of them to go on to graduate school, increasing the diversity of the broader STEM community.<br/><br/>This award supports the continued work of a successful EoR analysis team. Over the past four years innovations by the US imaging power spectrum (PS) team have driven the field forward and have led to the deepest EoR PS limits in the world. The investigators will make the next steps needed to reduce the limits by another order of magnitude with Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) data. Specifically, this work will make improvements in PS analyses with the MWA that will lower limits on the signal strength by an order of magnitude, making deep cuts into the possible parameter space for EoR models. This research will be invaluable for the entire 21 cm community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
176,Analysis of Impacts of Environmental and Natural Hazards on Human Migration,"Climate-related hazards are expected to permanently or temporarily displace millions of people around the world in the coming decades. In the US, coastal cities face the twin threats of sea-level rise and more intense tropical storms, with extreme precipitation contributing to more flood events, while Western states are primed by climate-related warming and drying for increased wildfire activity. Federal, state, and local governments have invested in hazard mitigation and adaptation to reinforce settlements against these environmental hazards, but increasingly scientists and policy actors are acknowledging that climate migration is inevitable. A coupled human and environmental understanding of the hazard-migration relationship anchored in the social sciences is critical for policy development around post-disaster rebuilding, population relocation, and managed retreat. <br/><br/>The project creates a new dataset called the Dataset on Environment-Migration Systems (DEMS) to investigate the effects of highly destructive climate-related hazards such as tropical cyclones, floods, and wildfires on migration behavior for the US population as well as for population subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, and nativity during the past 20 years. These hazards differ in their spatial and temporal scales, frequency, and the mechanisms by which they affect communities and provide contrasts to support investigations that build a broad understanding of hazard-driven human migration and why some demographic groups may be more prone to climate migration. To achieve the overarching project goal of understanding the effects of climate-related hazards on migration behavior, the work is structured around three core objectives: 1) construction of a new spatiotemporal dataset to support analyses of environmental hazards and internal US migration; 2) investigation of relationships between environmental hazards and the redistribution of the population as a whole and by sociodemographic sub-groups; and 3) support of public use of the DEMS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
177,Collaborative Research: Adaptative Strategies Under Empire Transitions,"Much is understood about how empires grow, but far less is known about how and why the effects of their growth persist among local populations from one regime to the next. Understanding the long-term economic, ecological, and health impacts of imperial expansions requires concerted attention to moments of transition between regimes, when both imperial powers and local populations adopt, reject, and/or reorganize existing infrastructure and resources. A team of researchers are employing strategies from archaeology, osteology, and biogeochemistry study how transitions between imperial regimes shape long-term trajectories in household economies, diet, and health and how they continue to have substantial legacy effects on the global distribution of wealth, political power, and health outcomes. The project provides critical training opportunities for students and enhances international understanding of an emerging heritage destination that provides substantial economic opportunities to local communities. <br/><br/>The project focuses on these transitions across two empires. The situation offers an excellent context for studying these processes because the empires had variable effects on local communities. By comparing indicators of household economic activity, diet, and health at sites, the project employs multidisciplinary perspectives to examine how changes in the organization of resources, infrastructure, and populations under one empire shaped pathways of development under the next and how Indigenous strategies of resilience responded to these successive challenges. The research contributes to a new theoretical framework for studying imperial transitions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
178,A test of a novel non-probabilistic model of 3D cue integration,"Despite at least a century of scientific investigation, it is still not entirely understood how the human brain constructs a perception of three-dimensional (3D) objects and space from the 2D information reaching the eye through light rays.  It has been known for a long time that this ability is attained on the basis of a variety of different visual signals (that the brain interprets) called “depth cues”, which the brain then combines together to derive the 3D structure of the scene.  Examples of depth cues can be observed in paintings where linear perspective, shading, and even simple contours depict a 3D world on the flat canvas just as they do on the flat human retinas while people observe real 3D objects. However, how these cues encode 3D information and how the different cues are combined to generate our stable coherent perception of 3D visual space and objects remains poorly understood.  The prevailing theory in the scientific literature (Bayesian probabilistic inference theory) postulates that the brain derives a 3D structure of the world by determining how likely a particular 3D structure is given the information on the retina. Implementing this model requires a host of assumptions, such as that depth cues deliver “noisy” estimates of 3D parameters that are still, on average, accurate. However, a number of common and important observations cannot be fully explained by the Bayesian model and cast doubt on the critical computational assumptions of the model. Moreover, the Bayesian model struggles to explain important differences in the “quality” of 3-dimensionality that we perceive between viewing the real world and artificial situations such as pictorial images, or virtual or augmented reality (VR, AR). This project tests a new theory (the Intrinsic Constrained theory) that makes an entirely different and simpler set of assumptions compared to the Bayesian theory, but that can predict a wider range of perceptual phenomena.  The project integrates the IC theory with a recently proposed theory that postulates that the visual system does not generate a single encoding of 3D space, but two distinct encodings, one which is relevant to understanding the scene (i.e., 3D object shape and layout) and the other that underlies visually guided movements like reaching for and grasping an object.  The latter encoding is claimed to underlie the special subjective experience of 3-dimensionality that is most obvious while viewing stereoscopic images (e.g., 3D movies). This project will show that the IC model can efficiently incorporate the claims of two distinct representation of 3D space. In doing so, it is able to provide a better explanation of a range of fundamental aspects of our perception of 3-dimensionality that are challenging to explain with the prevailing model, including those required for a better understanding of factors important for developing 3D technology (e.g., VR and AR). <br/><br/>This award supports empirical research that tests a computational model arising from the Intrinsic Constraint theory of cue integration against the prevailing computational model belonging to the Bayesian framework. Specifically, the new model challenges three main assumptions of the Bayesian model that will be tested by experiments in distinct work packages: (1) that depth cues on average provide veridical (accurate) 3D estimates; (2) that these estimates are stochastic and that their probability distributions are encoded by the visual system; and (3) that the process of cue integration results in a single encoding of 3D structure. Instead, the Intrinsic Constraint model predicts that cue estimates are biased, deterministic, and that cue integration results in two distinct encodings of 3D structure. Using state-of-the-art visual display and motion tracking apparatus that allow both psychophysical and psychomotor response measurements, the investigators are conducting a comprehensive set of experiments aimed at critically testing two theories (Bayesian and IC). The first work package establishes which theory better explains 3D perception based on single or combined depth cues. The second work package establishes if depth cues provide stochastic estimates as proposed by the Bayesian theory or if cues provide deterministic noise as proposed by the IC model, with noise in 3D estimates due to extraneous experimental factors. The third work package shows how differences in the subjective experience of 3-dimensionality is linked to the efficacy of the 3D encoding underlying guidance of movement, but not that underlying perceptual judgements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
179,Toward a Multi-Proxy Database of Pleistocene Water Isotope Records; Differentiating Precipitation Isotopic Composition from Precipitation Amount in the Asian Monsoon System,"Monsoon rainfall is critical to billions of people living within South Asia and East Asia. It is thus important to understand monsoon variability and how and why monsoons may change over time. This project will analyze a core from the Indian Ocean continental shelf to produce records of the monsoons over the last 640,000 years. The records will include changes in winds, rainfall, and river runoff. These records will be compared with records of known changes in temperature, greenhouse gases, and other potential monsoon forcing mechanisms. That comparison will help to understand the influence of climate on monsoon variability. Those records will also provide real-world tests for the numerical climate models used to predict future climate change. The project will support a woman graduate student. It also will provide research experiences for undergraduates recruited from groups typically underrepresented in the earth sciences.<br/><br/>Two parameters are key to understanding climate change - temperature and rainfall. Temperature reconstructions are now quantitative, accomplished by a number of independent means, and directly comparable to climate simulations. Rainfall is a difficult parameter to simulate even in the most advanced climate models because, for example, most rainfall happens at spatial scales far smaller than models can accommodate now and for the foreseeable future. Reconstructing rainfall in the past is similarly difficult and, at this point, qualitative. This research is part of a longer-term objective that focuses on resolving a key shortcoming in reconstructing rainfall, the capacity to differentiate changes in the isotopic composition of rainfall from rainfall amount in water isotope proxies commonly used to reconstruct rainfall (i.e. speleothem δ18O, sea water δ18O, and leaf wax δ2Η). Both the isotopic composition of the rainfall and the rainfall amount are important. The former yields information on source areas, transport paths, and dynamics taking place as moisture travels from source to sink (large-scale circulation). The latter provides information on changes in rainfall amount at the local to regional scale. Usefulness of these proxies depends on knowing what scale is expressed in the reconstruction. This research builds on past work, focusing here on leaf wax δ2Η. A 640,000-year record of leaf wax δ2H from the South Asian summer monsoon at Andaman Sea Site U1448 will be reconstructed at a nominal 2,000-year sample resolution. Supporting records, benthic δ18O (chronology), and leaf wax δ13C (vegetation structure) will be generated at the same resolution. The resulting records will be quantitatively assessed using time-series analytical techniques to determine the sensitivity to insolation, ice volume, sea level, and greenhouse gases as well as their timing (phase) relative to existing seawater δ18O, speleothem δ18O and leaf wax δ2Η records from the South- and East-Asian monsoon systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
180,Variational Methods in Singular Geometry,"Physical phenomena tend to obey the least action principle, namely moving in trajectories that make the action locally stationary. If the action is given by Dirichlet energy, then the stationary points are in some cases geodesics (shortest paths), and in other cases harmonic functions and various generalizations of these notions familiar from elementary physics. In this project, the PI will study stationary solutions either related to harmonic maps obtained by minimizing Dirichlet energy or best Lipschitz maps (sometimes called infinity harmonic) obtained by minimizing Lipschitz constants. Both problems have interesting applications to geometric topology and group theory. The project also includes significant training and mentoring of junior mathematicians (students, post-doctoral researchers, junior faculty)<br/> <br/>The work of Eells-Sampson in the 60's launched an explosion of research for harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds. Many important applications followed in minimal surface theory, Kaehler geometry and rigidity of group actions on manifolds among others. More recently, the seminal work of Gromov-Schoen and Korevaar-Schoen on harmonic maps to metric space targets initiated major progress in understanding phenomena associated with singular spaces, like rigidity of groups acting on buildings and the completion of Teichmueller space. In the first part of the project PI will study several problems in harmonic map theory for singular geometry with applications to Teichmueller theory. In the second part PI will study the calculus of variations of functionals associated with the sup-norm of the gradient of maps between Riemannian manifolds. Such functionals yield solutions of fully non-linear degenerate PDE's with very challenging regularity properties and whose singular set gives geometric realizations of topological objects like geodesic foliations and laminations related to Thurston theory. The PI will also train graduate students and maintains a robust mentoring program for all junior researchers in his department. The latter provides guidance and support to post-doctoral researchers and junior faculty on a range of issues related to professional development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
181,GOALI: Chemomechanical Failure Mechanisms in Inorganic Solid Electrolytes,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Solid electrolytes are the enabling material for the successful development of solid-state batteries. Ceramic and glass solid electrolytes with sufficiently high ionic conductivities have been developed in recent years, however, these materials still face significant challenges. The research in this project addresses degradation mechanisms that are associated with the combined effects of chemical and mechanical phenomena. The transformative impact of this work is being demonstrated through substantial improvements in the performance of solid-state batteries. Implementation is facilitated by direct collaborations with the GOALI partner, which includes work on the synthesis and testing of novel electrolytes. Researchers from Brown University are working directly with Dr. Xingcheng Xiao and others at General Motors (GM), in ways that expand educational outcomes and enhance knowledge transfer to industry. Via these direct interactions with industrial collaborators, the resulting new knowledge is being applied to commercially viable systems. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: Solid-state lithium batteries provide key improvements compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries based on liquid electrolytes. In particular, the implementation of solid electrolytes can potentially increase energy density through the safe use of Li metal anodes. This research project employs precise in situ stress measurements along with other experimental methods to investigate a variety of chemo-mechanical phenomena in solid electrolytes (e.g., Li metal penetration, large scale bridging effects in nanocomposites, viscoplasticity in sulfide glasses, etc.). This includes focused efforts to understand and mitigate the formation of dendrite-like lithium filaments, a critical failure mechanism where mechanical stresses appear to play an important role. This and other aspects of chemo-mechanical degradation are being investigated with research on three distinct types of materials: (1) single phase ceramic oxides (primarily garnet-type materials) that undergo purely elastic deformation; (2) nanocomposite electrolytes where nanoplatelets, nanotubes, and nanofibers increase the fracture toughness; (3) sulfide glass electrolytes that are subject to rate dependent deformation. Interpretation of these data is based on detailed finite element modeling. Extensive collaborations with the GOALI partner facilitate knowledge transfer to industry. Education elements of this project include a doctoral student working as a summer intern at GM, and research training opportunities at Brown University for undergraduate women from Wellesley College.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
182,CBET-EPSRC: Droplet Impact on Fluid Interfaces: 3D Effects Across Scales,"This NSF-EPSRC project represents an integrated, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary investigation of droplets impacting onto liquid layers, with particular attention paid to three-dimensional effects that often arise in applications. Droplet-liquid impacts are fundamental to a range of industrial, agricultural, advanced manufacturing, environmental, and aerospace applications. As a droplet impinges on a liquid layer, several distinct outcomes are possible, which include complete rebound (bouncing), merging (deposition), and splashing. Depending on the target area of interest, each of these three distinct outcomes can be either desirable or undesirable. Broadening our current understanding of droplet impact phenomena to include three-dimensional effects is of critical and timely importance to unlocking and advancing real-world applications. This research program makes use of slow-motion photography and cutting-edge computer simulations. Collaborators at the University of Oxford and the University of Warwick will carry out the high-energy impact experiments and direct numerical simulations over all regimes of interest, respectively. Partners from the inkjet printing and aerospace industries are engaged in this project, ensuring a direct and accelerated track for knowledge transfer. The striking visual nature of droplet impact phenomena will also translate directly into the development of numerous outreach activities in collaboration with artists and graphic designers, with a target audience of young students from underrepresented and disadvantaged groups. <br/><br/>The bulk of prior work on droplet-liquid and droplet-solid impact focuses on axisymmetric, normal impacts due to the relative simplicity of experimental characterization and visualization, and reduced computational demands. In practice, non-axisymmetric droplet-interface impacts are far more common. Recent advances in high-speed visualization, flow measurement techniques, multi-scale algorithms, and associated computing power will facilitate the proposed work plans and objectives. Studies in the present project include (i) normal impacts, with particular attention to the role of the interstitial gas layer, (ii) impacts onto a moving liquid layer, and (iii) oblique impacts. Each study focuses on delineating parametric thresholds between the impact regimes of rebound, coalescence, and splashing through a synthesis of experiments, high-fidelity numerical simulation, and reduced-order modeling and scaling analysis. The research outputs are anticipated not only to include the specific scientific discoveries, but also benchmarked and documented experimental and computational tools and datasets that will strengthen the broad global research efforts in the area, as well as a myriad of related topics including droplet-solid impacts, particle-liquid impacts, and droplet-droplet collisions. Having industrial partners involved in the project will ensure a streamlined pathway for the translation of the scientific advances towards real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
183,Collaborative Research: Nonlinear Dynamics and Spectral Analysis in Dispersive Partial Differential Equations,"Internal deep-water waves, ion-acoustic waves in a plasma, laser propagation in highly refractive materials, and collective particle behavior in very low temperature gases are all physical systems whose behavior in time is modeled by a nonlinear dispersive wave equation. The term ""nonlinear"" refers to a property of size-dependent response and the term ""dispersive"" refers to how the fluctuations of the wave influence the speed and direction of motion. At the mathematical level, one studies the behavior of general solutions and special types of solutions to these equations and seeks to provide quantitative descriptions of phenomena observed in the physical setting. In this project, the investigators explore how coherent waves travel - whether they retain their shape despite encountering obstacles, break apart and dissolve, or collapse into a singularity. Each of these possibilities hinges on both the nonlinear and the dispersive character of the equations; over the past several decades, mathematical techniques have been developed to model and measure these properties. The project aims to improve existing methods and apply the methods in new directions. The project contains educational efforts at various levels of mathematical learning. These include advising undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars, with special emphasis on attracting underrepresented minorities. <br/> <br/>The main objective of the research will be to provide analytical descriptions of the behavior of solutions to certain classes of nonlinear dispersive equations. The two main categories of equations considered are the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) family and the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) family. Both classes of equations satisfy powerful dispersive estimates called local virial estimates, and the KdV family in addition satisfies a monotonicity property that controls the movement of mass. The multiple-scale method, spectral analysis, application of dispersive estimates, and monotonicity bounds are core methods that will be utilized and extended. Several focus problems are identified in which some classical feature, like scale-invariance or a property of localized influence, have been removed or weakened, providing the stimulus to develop new techniques, while at the same time, provide new descriptions of real physical phenomena. The phenomena of primary interest are the dynamics of coherent structures like solitary waves and line solitons as they interact with each other and their environment, and the description of how singular collapsing solutions arise and their asymptotic description.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
184,Mapping Class Group and Fiber Bundles,"This project is concerned with the study of spaces (manifolds), especially in dimensions 2, 3, and 4. In the study of these objects, a fundamental role is played by the mapping class group, which captures the symmetries of a space and encodes gluing data for building new spaces, such as fiber bundles. The study of mapping class groups is a meeting ground for many areas including geometric group theory, dynamics, homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. This project focuses on using mapping class groups to understand geometric properties of fiber bundles. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students and includes organizing the Brown-Yale Geometry and Topology Conference. <br/><br/>The project has three main objectives. (1) Find new examples of non-flat bundles, especially surface bundles whose base is low-dimensional. Research in this direction will increase our understanding of the dynamics of surface homeomorphisms, the algebra of mapping class groups, and their relation. (2) Establish new connections between the dynamical properties of a pseudo-Anosov surface homeomorphism and the (non)arithmeticity of the associated hyperbolic mapping torus, thereby building on work of Thurston and Bowditch-Maclachlan-Reid. (3) Provide new examples of convex-cocompact subgroups of the mapping class group. This work is aimed at a conjecture of Farb-Mosher regarding purely pseudo-Anosov subgroups of mapping class groups, and it also has connections to 3-manifold topology. The project will also support the advising of students and the organization of a conference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
185,East Asian monsoon response to changes in Earth’s orbit: A new stable isotope modeling study,"Understanding the timing, intensity, duration, and spatial extent of Asian monsoon rainfall is important for the large population across Asia. Meanwhile, a perspective from geological records of past climates can give insights into how the Asian monsoon will respond to anthropogenic forcing of future climate scenarios. Speleothems from caves had created a unique opportunity to study past climates because the oxygen isotopic ratios preserved in their minerals record environmental information when they were formed. Oxygen isotope ratios have been shown to exhibit a close relationship with the amount of summer solar radiation in the northern hemisphere, which varies due to changes in Earth’s orbit. However, so far, there is no consensus on why the oxygen isotopic composition in speleothems follows the Earth’s orbital variation. This project will compare observed and modeled isotopic composition to inform a better understanding of the climate dynamics of the East Asian monsoon, thus improving our predictive ability of the East Asian monsoon. Additionally, the researchers will work with the next generation of scientists, engineers, and citizens by (1) participating in Brown Earth Sciences curriculum design and teaching program to the local schools with a high percentage of under-represented students and (2) providing research opportunities in climate science to undergraduate researchers from minority-serving colleges and universities during the summer.<br/><br/>This research proposes incorporating stable water isotopes into the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Coupled Climate Model, allowing researchers to compare observed and modeled isotopes and disentangle what causes the variation of isotopes. Previous research from this research group supports the hypothesis that precipitation in the East Asian monsoon region is sensitive to summer insolation, emphasizing the importance of ocean dynamics in understanding the Asian monsoon system. This research will validate the incorporated isotope model using present-day observations, perform past climate model simulations with a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere-land configuration, and assess the role of ocean circulation in the dynamics of the East Asian monsoon in response to the Earth’s orbit change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
186,DNA Base Excision Repair in Chromatin,"The environment contains many reactive species that can damage DNA in living organisms. Exposure to these reactive species generates an array of DNA damage lesions that alter the genetic blueprint of cells and threaten all aspects organismal function, as well as the faithful transfer of genetic information to the next generation. A variety of repair pathways have evolved to protect DNA, including base excision repair (BER) in which damaged DNA bases are removed and replaced with undamaged ones. This project investigates how BER acts on DNA packaged by proteins into chromatin – the form DNA takes inside cells. The goal is to determine how this packaging influences DNA repair and to identify ways that cells overcome challenges associated with repairing DNA secluded within chromatin. The project will offer training opportunities to students, including undergraduates from women’s colleges, in DNA chemistry, protein biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. These skills will enable students to pursue STEM careers in research and education, and to contribute to biotechnology industries. Science outreach to middle school students is planned as well.<br/><br/>BER is a coordinated series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions in which a damaged base in DNA is removed and replaced. A paradoxical aspect of this fundamental cellular process that still remains poorly understood is the ability of BER to repair DNA when it is packaged in chromatin, which can limit enzyme access to damaged bases. The research will employ an innovative “repair fingerprint” technique that can precisely identify locations in chromatin where BER enzymes are catalytically active as well as those that are refractory to repair. This technique, as well as a variety of biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology approaches will be employed to (i) determine how DNA base flipping is controlled in packaged DNA, (ii) understand how the density of DNA packaging modulates BER, and (iii) establish the contribution of a damage sensor protein to BER in packaged DNA. The outcomes will help answer key questions regarding cellular mechanisms to overcome the packaging paradox and prevent genomic instability.<br/><br/>This research is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate of Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
187,Collaborative Research: Community Facility Support: Facilitating Access and Innovation through a Collaborative Organization for Rock Deformation (CORD),"This award provides support to continue a community facility for rock deformation by providing partial funding for two full-time laboratory technician positions, both of which will jointly support the rock deformation laboratories at both Brown University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology as part of CORD: Collaborative Organization for Rock Deformation. Educational and research interactions through CORD will benefit faculty, students and staff visiting this facility. Experimental rock deformation studies provide fundamental insights into the natural phenomena which shape our Earth and other planets, including earthquake generation and viscous flow of rocks and ices. Increasing knowledge of rock properties also plays a key role in meeting societal needs such as exploiting natural resources and enabling CO2 sequestration to mitigate climate change. Owing to technical complexity, only a handful of laboratories exist in the US with the capability to perform such work. Beyond dedicated experimentalists running the equipment, there is a broad user community with interest in performing experiments but without the resources and experience to start their own laboratories. The key challenge in increasing access to existing equipment is the training of users, and maintenance and safe operation of complex machinery. The presence of dedicated technical personnel is an effective way to facilitate access to this sophisticated equipment for a much broader section of the Earth science community and provide a robust, effective, and welcoming laboratory research environment. Visiting scientists will be able to become acquainted with faculty, staff, and students at MIT and Brown. Besides improving outreach to other universities and organizations, the CORD project will promote coordination between the two partner laboratories. Regular meetings, lectures and workshops that can be attended by all those interested available by web-link will be held. Both groups will benefit from insights and best practices developed at both institutions. Lastly, the presence of dedicated technical personnel will facilitate the development of new experimental capabilities, pushing the boundaries of experimental geophysics.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposal is to encourage and facilitate participation in experimental rock deformation studies by a broader spectrum of scientists within the Earth science community. The technician support increases the availability and efficiency of use of the equipment in the PI’s laboratories to colleagues from other organizations, who are interested in rock deformation, but currently lack access to laboratory these facilities and expertise. The secondary goal is to develop new experimental capabilities. Each laboratory technician has become an expert operator of equipment, and in close collaboration with the PI’s, can train new users. The primary responsibility of the technicians is to maintain the equipment in dependable working order and enable its safe and efficient operation with a broad user base. Maintenance is a priority for maximizing access to visitors working on fixed schedules. Routine tasks include training of new users in collaboration with PIs, and replacement of seals and gaskets, calibration of load cells, displacement transducers etc. The technicians will organize and ensure consistent archiving of experimental data. Other duties include maintaining inventories of consumables and lists of suppliers. Assisting in the design and implementation of new innovative capabilities of the equipment is also an important component of the responsibilities. Scientific and technical advances go hand-in-hand. Sharing technical support provides inter-laboratory calibrations, innovation, standardization of techniques, and development of a consistent format for data management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
188,Collaborative Research:  LoVoCCS: The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey,"The primary goal of this project is to map the dark matter structures in a large sample of nearby galaxy clusters using data from the Dark Energy Camera at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The investigators will study how dark matter forms structures of various sizes in the clusters. The images will provide the nearby comparison sample to the more distant clusters that will be observed with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. The project includes programs for student research at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. The outreach programs will take place in both the Providence Public School system and the south-east Ohio Appalachian region. <br/><br/>The distribution of mass in a complete sample of clusters will be measured via weak lensing, measuring the distortion of the observed shape of background galaxies due to the curvature of space-time around the matter in the cluster. This distribution of mass will be mapped and compared to the distribution of cluster galaxies and X-ray emitting gas. Two-dimensional maps of the mass will be reconstructed with high enough resolution to identify individual concentrations within the cluster (“substructures”). In addition, the effect of these substructures on the estimates of the total mass of the clusters will be measured. This will determine the mass calibration biases in upcoming cluster surveys. These observations are similar in depth to the upcoming observations from the Vera Rubin Observatory, enabling a transient survey in and behind nearby clusters with the first-year of data from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The project will make public releases of deep optical images, catalogs, and maps of the dark matter yearly. These releases are designed to help other researchers become familiar with the data format and quality of the future LSST datasets. The investigators will recruit students into science using proven outreach programs, while partnering with the staff at Ladd Observatory, the Brown Science Prep program, and the Providence Children’s Museum. Through these programs, the investigators will introduce fundamental aspects of astronomy to the large percentage of underprivileged and minority students in the Providence public school system. A similar outreach program will be implemented in the historically under-served and poverty-stricken south-east Ohio Appalachian region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
189,Geometric optimization and polygonal geometry,"This project involves the use of computer experimentation and graphical user interfaces to study simple but unsolved geometric problems. The PI is currently studying the paths taken by a superball as it bounces around the inside of a tetrahedral shaped room. The project will use computer experimentation to figure out how the patterns change as the room gradually changes shape. As another example, the PI is studying how bugs will crawl around the surface of a dodecahedron in order to move as far away from each other as possible. These simply defined problems exhibit a fascinating and sometimes unexpected complexity. These types of problems fall under the general rubric of geometric optimization and polygonal geometry. The project also involves training and mentoring of students, as well as dissemination via outreach and the creation of applets and computer programs to aid geometric visualization.<br/><br/>In this project the PI will work on questions in geometry and dynamics which fall into two categories: geometric optimization and polygon geometry. The three main optimization topics that will be studied in this project are point configurations, paper Moebius bands, and the Lie group Sol. The three main polygon problems that will be investigated are polygonal outer billiards, symplectic polygonal billiards, and inscribed triangles and rectangles. Additionally, the PI plans to continue writing graphical user interfaces which help with research for the project, and the PI also plans to continue to write and illustrate children's math books.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
190,"FRG: Collaborative Research: Matroids, Graphs, and Algebraic Geometry","Recent advances in matroid and graph theory fuse the methods of combinatorics with concepts from algebraic geometry to resolve longstanding conjectures and provide deep insights into widespread phenomena such as unimodality and log concavity of integer sequences. The influences between combinatorics and algebraic geometry flow fruitfully in both directions; combinatorial constructions such as graph complexes have recently led to resolutions of long-standing conjectures in the geometry of moduli spaces of curves. The PIs will join forces and forge timely new collaborations to address the most pressing open problems at the interface between matroids, graphs, and algebraic geometry. The project includes the participation of graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>This focused research group will build on recent breakthroughs to accomplish the following goals: 1. Study matroidal generalizations of Kontsevich’s graph complex and pursue applications to the top weight cohomology of moduli spaces of abelian varieties; 2. Investigate K-theoretic analogs of the Chow ring of a matroid, with a view toward a matroidal analog of the Hecke algebra and applications to matroidal Kazhdan-Lusztig theory; 3. Prove a categorification of the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations in the presence of a finite group action, and pursue equivariant log concavity for the characteristic polynomial of a matroid with automorphisms; 4. Use methods inspired by the hard Lefschetz theorem to attack both the Welsh conjecture on the number of isomorphism classes of matroids of given size and rank and the Harary edge reconstruction conjecture for graphs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
191,Studies in Moduli Theory and Birational Geometry,"The area of study of this project lies within algebraic geometry, the branch of mathematics devoted to geometric shapes called algebraic varieties, defined by polynomial equations. Algebraic geometry has significant applications in coding, industrial control, computation, and theoretical physics, where physicists consider algebraic varieties as a piece of the fine structure of our universe. One focus in this project is Moduli theory, which studies a remarkable phenomenon in which the collection of all algebraic varieties of the same type is often manifested as an algebraic variety in its own right, called a moduli space. Thus in algebraic geometry, the metaphor of thinking about a community of ""organisms"" as itself being an ""organism"" is not just a metaphor but a rigorous and quite useful fact. The other focus in this project is birational geometry, focusing here on resolution of singularities. Resolution of singularities is a fundamental procedure where ""bad"" points of an algebraic variety are removed and replaced by ""good"" points. This project includes research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>In more detail, the PI will continue studying problems in birational geometry, focusing on resolution of singularities, semistable reduction, and the geometry of stack theoretic birational modifications. The PI and collaborators will build on recently completed work to functorially resolve singularities of proper families of varieties; to study the geometry of weighted blowings up and more general stack-theoretic procedures; and to study subtle phenomena in positive characteristics. In addition, the PI will continue to study moduli spaces. The main foci are Moduli and arithmetic of subvarieties of families of abelian varieties, aiming to extend recent non-degeneracy and uniformity results of rational points on curves to symmetric squares of curves and related constructions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
192,A one-million record of orbital-scale changes in temperature and precipitation from the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool,"Tropical climate is changing rapidly – rainfall events are becoming more intense, and droughts more severe. These changes affect the affect the lives of billions of people who rely on rainfall for their livelihoods, and have important implications for the world due to connections between tropical and global climates. Predicting how rainfall and temperature will change in the future requires long records to test climate models and theory. Such records are generally scarce in the tropics, and particularly in the tropical western Pacific, where existing records disagree substantially on the pattern and magnitude of past changes in climate. The goal of this project is to develop new records of temperature, rainfall, and vegetation from the tropical western Pacific, a region that is especially important to global climate processes, and to investigate their causes. This research will enable us to test theories of tropical and global climate change, and thereby to improve the prediction of future climates in this region. The project will provide for many opportunities for US graduate and undergraduate students to conduct research and will develop new classroom modules on climate change to be used in the Providence Public School System.<br/><br/><br/>This research will investigate orbital-scale variations in rainfall, temperature, and vegetation during the past 1.1 million years in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) through analysis of recently-recovered sediment drill cores from Lake Towuti, located on Sulawesi Island in central Indonesia. Through organic geochemical analyses of these sediments, the project will evaluate the impacts of changes in tropical seasonal insolation, high-latitude ice volume, temperature, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and sea level on IPWP climate across critical transitions in global climate boundary conditions. The research will focus on global climate transitions during the Mid-Pleistocene, 800,000 years ago, when glacial-interglacial variability transitioned from predominantly 41-kyr to 100-kyr ice-age cycles, and 430,000, when the 100-kyr cycles intensified. The results are expected to contribute to understanding how tropical climates change in response to climate boundary conditions that differ from the present day.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
193,Collaborative Research: Are Amazonian and Andean ecosystems close to a tipping point?,"Amazonian rainforests are famous for the immense biological and cultural diversity they support. These forests are also a vital part of global recycling of freshwater, and their loss has implications for food security for millions of people as well as global climate dynamics. Climate change is threatening these systems and there are concerns that as temperatures rise and rainfall becomes less reliable, these forests might be replaced by low-diversity grasslands. However, it is unclear what level of climate change might trigger a forest-to-grassland transition. Paleoecology can provide information about biological diversity in the past, and how biodiversity patterns changed during past warming events. This research project will investigate two periods of climate warming, one that lasted from about 8000 to 5000 years ago, and another even warmer time that lasted from 128,000 to 120,000 years ago. Ancient lakes build up sediments through time, and by taking a drill-core down through the sediment the history of the region can be captured in the lake mud. The researchers will analyze the fossil and chemical content of lake sediment cores from seven locations in the Amazon and Andes to establish how much the climate changed in the past, and whether those changes were enough to induce a shift from forest to grassland. By looking at a range of locations that vary in moisture, from very wet to quite dry, and degree of warming, the researchers will estimate how close the modern rainforest is to a forest-to-grassland transition. Additionally, new interactions between the collaborating research groups will include a co-taught paleoecology/paleoclimatology course, a sponsored category in a local film festival, and training of at least 10 undergraduates, two doctoral students, and one postdoctoral researcher. <br/><br/>The research will address a number of hypotheses relating to climate-vegetation responses such as flickering, teleconnections, ecosystem buffering, and tipping points. By using organic geochemical data to estimate paleotemperature, leaf wax isotopes to estimate precipitation, sediment chemistry to characterize droughts, fossil pollen to reconstruct vegetation, and charcoal to reconstruct fire frequency, the researchers will investigate ecosystem change under conditions as much as 2 degrees C (4 degrees F) warmer than the present. The Last Interglacial will provide an index of scale of change in traits, fire prevalence and community composition in a climate 1-2 degrees C warmer than modern. In the directly-dated Holocene, the data will assess sub-decadal variance in ecosystem indicators, and allow rates of change to be investigated. Currently, no high-resolution records of Amazonian temperature exist, so the novel approach of separating climatic change from that of ecological proxies will be transformational for quantitative neotropical paleoecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
194,Probing the Structures and Chemical Bonding of Size-Selected Boron and Metal-Boride Nanoclusters,"In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Lai-Sheng Wang of Brown University and his students are using advanced spectroscopic techniques to study tiny structures (nanoclusters) formed from boron atoms and metal borides, which combine boron with metallic elements. Boron is next to carbon on the periodic table, but having one-fewer electrons than carbon leads to boron being characterized as an electron-deficient element. The electron deficiency of boron results in distinctive chemical and physical properties for boron-containing molecules and materials, and boron and metal boride nanoclusters display a rich range of structural and chemical bonding characteristics. There are significant experimental challenges to study these clusters, which exist only briefly before reacting to form more stable species, and, thus, must be carefully prepared. Professor Wang and his students are overcoming these challenges by developing innovative experimental techniques to investigate the structures and bonding of boron and metal-boride nanoclusters. The research not only provides fundamental knowledge about the boron-boron and metal-boron chemical bonding, but also has the potential to discover new boron and metal-boride nanomaterials valuable for industrial applications. The students engaged in this research are gaining critical thinking skills and valuable experience in advanced physical chemistry techniques. <br/><br/>The project focuses on 1) structural evolution of large boron clusters to lay the foundation for new boron nanostructures and 2) metal-boride clusters to probe the nature of the metal-boron chemical bonds. These clusters are produced using a laser-vaporization cluster source and investigated using two different types of home-built photoelectron spectroscopic apparatuses. One apparatus involves a magnetic-bottle photoelectron analyzer and is aimed to provide spectra with a wide range of photon energies. Well-resolved photoelectron spectra provide electronic fingerprints, which are crucial to be used to compare with theoretical calculations to elucidate the structures and bonding of size-selected clusters. A cryogenically-cooled ion trap is being developed to create cold boron clusters, which are essential to obtain well-resolved photoelectron spectra for large clusters. The second apparatus involves high-resolution photoelectron imaging, which is aimed to obtain vibrational information. The broader impact of this work includes the discovery of novel boron-based nanomaterials, which have potential technological applications and societal benefits. This project is integrated with the teaching of physical chemistry by Professor Wang, as well as providing training opportunities for students and postdoctoral associates in the design and construction of advanced experimental instrumentation and computational chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
195,Tracking Urban Nitrous Acid (HONO) Emissions and Secondary Production in the Great Lakes Region during Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE),"This project contributes to the Michigan-Ontario Ozone Source Experiment (MOOSE) field campaign scheduled to take place in the summers of 2021 and 2022 over metropolitan Detroit. MOOSE is a collaborative effort sponsored by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), and includes participation from the Canadian government, NOAA, NASA, USEPA and the USFS. The goal of the campaign is to improve the understanding of the sources and chemistry associated with the production of ozone air pollution in the region.<br/><br/>The research in this project supported by NSF includes the testing of hypotheses to better understand heterogeneous pathways to HONO formation and includes the measurement of stable isotopes that will serve as a unique tool to rigorously constrain sources, chemical processing pathways, and sinks of reactive nitrogen species based upon their respective isotopic signatures. This effort is expected to help to clarify the role of HONO in ozone production. The project includes improvements that will be made to the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) chemical transport model that will benefit users of the model.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
196,Collaborative Research: CAS: Carbene-Containing Ligands on Cu and Cu3N Nanocubes: Access to Stable and Selective Electrolysis for CO2 Reduction,"With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors He and Ung at the University of Connecticut and Professor Sun at Brown University are designing new hybrid materials for selective electrochemical activation of carbon dioxide (CO2). The team will utilize synthetic polymers to coat and protect copper-based catalysts, allowing the resulting hybrid materials to be more robust and efficient for CO2 electroreduction to yield value-added hydrocarbon products. The use of renewable electricity to convert CO2 to useful chemical products is likely to be an important component of sustainability. This collaborative project will involve undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate researchers from two universities, and will utilize each groups’ expertise in polymer, nanomaterial, organometallic, surface science, and electrochemistry. The results obtained from this project will be disseminated to science and engineering students through joint meetings, courses, undergraduate research activities, and outreach activities. The PIs are collaborating with local high schools and outreach programs in the southern New England region to attract students into studies and potential career paths in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>With the support of the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors He and Ung at the University of Connecticut and Professor Sun at Brown University are studying new Cu-based nanocubes functionalized with synthetic polymer ligands toward stable and selective electroreduction of CO2. The central hypothesis of this proposal is twofold: i) the incorporation of Cu-based nanocubes with rationally designed synthetic polymers to prevent interparticle coalescence and surface corrosion during electroreduction, and ii) hydrophobic polymer ligands to control the microenvironment of nanocubes and improve the selectivity of nanocubes. Polymer ligands terminated with N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) will be anchored on Cu, copper nitride (Cu3N) and core-shell Cu/Cu3N nanocubes through stable NHC-Cu bonds. Those nanocubes have maximum (100) surface exposure to efficiently promote C-C coupling and form C2+ hydrocarbon products. Polymer NHC ligands will balance the localized proton concentration nearby the surface of nanocubes through control over polymer chain lengths and hydrophobicity to achieve maximum catalytic proton-assisted CO2 reduction to C-C coupling products and minimize proton reduction reaction. The Cu-NHC bond stability and the structural integrity of polymer-grafted Cu and Cu3N nanocubes will be probed using in situ spectroscopies and microscopies. The polymer chain length dependent diffusion properties will be quantitatively measured and correlated to the catalytic performance of Cu and Cu3N nanocubes. The successful demonstration of the active and efficient polymer NHC-Cu nanocubes for CO2 electroreduction also allows tackling more broadly the long-term stability issues of all other cathodic nanocatalysts to improve the sustainability of electroreduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
197,Measurement of In Situ Mechanical Forces During Neotissue Formation,"This grant will use tiny force sensors to measure the forces that exist during the earliest stages of tissue formation and for the maturation stages that follow. The push and pull of cells on each other are a critical part of biological development and tissue formation. This is particularly true for the growth of muscles, bones, and connective tissues in our bodies. Cells are stimulated by these local forces, responding in ways that help create the complex structures needed for more mature tissues to function properly. Direct measurement of cellular-scale forces is difficult, particularly in cell-dense, 3D samples. The information gained from this work will fill a knowledge gap in developmental biology and tissue regeneration. The research team will include a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, in addition to local public school teachers, who will be central to our outreach efforts in communicating the importance of interdisciplinary research to high school students.<br/><br/>To accomplish our goals, two objectives have been established. First, we will determine how the physical characteristics of our cellular-scale force probes influence measurements in a model system of tissue formation. This includes the size, stiffness, and chemical coating of the probes. Second, we will investigate how local mechanical forces change over time as cartilage-like and tendon/ligament-like neotissues form and mature. These studies will provide completely new insight on the relevance of forces in cell-dense biological structures, benefiting fields as diverse as developmental biology and tissue engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
198,"Collaborative Research: Fire, ecosystem, and landscape dynamics in Afroalpine environments in a warmer world","Mountain regions are sensitive to climate change, where recent warming has contributed to changes in species, declines in water resources, and increasingly intense fires. The interactions between climate change, wildfire, and water cycles are well-studied in many mountain regions, such as the western United States, where forest fires are very frequent. Recent events suggest that wildfire may also be an emerging threat to tropical mountain environments, where natural fires are thought to be rare. The effects of wildfires on forest composition and water resources in tropical mountain regions are poorly known. The goal of this project is to investigate the causes of changes in fire, vegetation, and flooding in tropical mountains, specifically in the Rwenzori Mountains National Park, Uganda. This research will improve our ability to predict the responses of tropical mountain systems to future climate change and establish a basis for management strategies related to fire in these ecosystems. The project will provide opportunities for many graduate and undergraduate students to conduct research, will deliver a short course on climate and vegetation modeling, and will develop new classroom modules to be used in the Providence Public School System.<br/> <br/>This research will investigate the interactions between climate, fire regimes, vegetation composition, and flooding through analysis of lake sediment cores recovered from alpine environments in the Rwenzori Mountains, a site famous for its biodiversity. The project will test the hypothesis that changes in fire regimes in tropical mountain environments are influenced by temperature change. The role of changing fire regimes in influencing vegetation assemblages and catalyzing flood events will also be examined. The project will generate new paleoecological and paleoclimatological records based on several aspects of the sediment cores: fossil charcoal and pollen composition, organic geochemical data, and sediment composition. These analyses will focus on time intervals such as the mid-Holocene, when temperatures were warmer than the present day, to investigate how warm temperatures influenced ecosystem dynamics. The results are expected to contribute to the understanding of ecosystem dynamics and resilience in poorly-studied Afroalpine environments. This project is co-funded by the Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
199,Emergent Opto-Mechanical and Electro-Mechanical Coupled Behavior of Halide Perovskites,"Nontechnical Description<br/>So-called ‘halide perovskites’ are a family of materials at the heart of a new type of solar-cell technology. These new solar cells are showing great promise as they are not only highly efficient in converting sunlight into electricity but also potentially very inexpensive to manufacture. However, the mechanical properties of these new solar cell materials are not known, especially under operating conditions of a solar cell: in sunlight, and also when electric current is passing through them. Thus, it is very important to study and understand these properties because they determine the long-term durability of the new solar cells, which are expected to operate efficiently for twenty years or more in the element. To that end, systematic research is conducted, where the following relevant mechanical properties of the new solar cell materials are studied under light and/or electric current: (1) cracking and healing of the cracks; (2) plastic deformation; and (3) time-dependent deformation. These studies are conducted on materials of well-defined chemical compositions, configurations, and morphologies. The results from these studies are analyzed critically to understand the behavior of the new solar cell materials. This is expected to have a broad impact on the ability to make highly durable, low-cost solar cells of the future, and to help this new solar-cell technology then reach its full potential. As part of this effort, underrepresented minority undergraduate researchers from Tugaloo College are trained. This leverages the fifty-year old partnership between Brown University and Tugaloo College -- an Historically Black College or University. The public outreach effort is aimed at enhancing the public's understanding of concepts in science, engineering, and technology. This entails leveraging the well-established science cartoons (SciToons) program at Brown University for creating two new SciToons on: ‘Emerging Solar Cells Technologies’ and ‘Strength of Materials.’<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>There are compelling reasons to suggest there are fascinating, rich opto-mechanical and electro-mechanical coupled behavior in halide perovskite materials, yet there is extreme paucity of research in this area. Considering the unprecedented promise of halide perovskites for new types of solar-cell and other devices, it is imperative to have a more in-depth understanding of the mechanical degradation of halide perovskites coupled with optical and/or electrical stimuli that are ubiquitous in devices. To that end, this project comes at a highly opportune time, and it entails four interrelated Tasks, and several Subtasks within. In Task 1, the effect of electric field on the fracture and crack-healing behavior in halide perovskite single-crystals and thin films is studied experimentally and quantified. Task 2 involves the quantitative study of plastic deformation of halide perovskite single-crystals, and the effect of light (photoplasticity). In Task 3, the effect of electric field on the time-dependent creep deformation of halide perovskite bulk polycrystalline pellets is studied. The efficient generation of photocarriers and facile ion migration in soft halide perovskites are expected to mediate crack-healing, plasticity, and creep phenomena, through their interactions with point and line (dislocations) defects in halide perovskites. Finally, in Task 4 the manifestation of photoplasticity effects, as an example, are demonstrated in devices. The considerable research infrastructure needed for the project developed at Brown University is leveraged fully. This research contributes to the scientific foundation for the development of next-generation perovskite solar-cell and other devices that are more efficient, and importantly more durable over the long term. As such, this research is expected to be highly impactful, and useful to researchers and technology developers alike.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
200,Experimental constraints on the rheology of the mantle lithosphere at the base of the seismogenic zone,"The largest and most damaging earthquakes occur along plate boundaries where lithosphere is subducted beneath the continents. Geoscientists have discovered that a wide range of fault slip processes occur in these regions, and significant progress has been made understanding these events by integrating geophysical observations with models and constraints from lab experiments. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of mechanical properties at the relevant conditions. Previous work at these conditions has been hindered by relatively poor resolution of the stresses being imposed on the sample during an experiment. The investigators have made new modifications to their high-pressure equipment that will lead to significant improvement in the ability to measure stress and characterize the fault slip behavior that occurs within the subduction zone environment. The results will provide new constraints necessary to understand how earthquake slip initiates and to explain why there is a limited depth range over which the earthquakes occur. The project will fund two Ph.D. students (one completing a thesis and another starting a thesis during the duration of the project). Outreach will be coordinated with the Department’s DEEPS STEP (STEM in Providence Public Schools) program. Engagement in rock mechanics, with its strong links to engineering, has the potential to bridge a gap to URM STEM students, who remain dramatically underrepresented in Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This project involves experiments to: (a) quantify frictional behavior at high-temperature under both dry and wet conditions; (b) investigate low temperature plasticity of olivine aggregates at high pressure conditions near the brittle-plastic transition, which is also relevant for constraining the extrapolation of rate-and-state friction laws to mantle conditions; (c) constrain the role of dehydration reactions on the frictional stability of the lithosphere; and (d) determine frictional behavior and flow law parameters for alteration phases at high pressure to constrain the strength of altered lithosphere (and stress state prior to dehydration). The improvements to the investigator's apparatus enhances the ability to: (a) conduct creep tests, which will allow acquisition of better data to constrain flow law parameters; and (b) resolve transient deformation, which significantly improves the ability to quantify rate-and-state friction parameters at the high pressure conditions where seismicity occurs. The results will provide constraints for a wide range of scientists interested in the diverse fields of metamorphism, geodynamics, seismology, the physics of earthquakes, and fluid transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
201,"Seismological studies of cratonic lithosphere: investigating lithospheric rheology, heat flow beneath ice sheets, and the origin of mid-lithospheric discontinuities","There are fundamental differences between the oceanic crust that comprises the seafloor and the continental crust on which humans live. Continental crust is thicker and lighter than oceanic crust. It is also, on average, much older: the oldest oceanic crust is 200 million years whereas the oldest continental crust is 4300 million years. All of these differences—thickness, buoyancy, and age—can be attributed to the properties of and the processes occurring within the Earth’s mantle. This study will use seismic waves generated by earthquakes to image the mantle beneath continents, employing methods similar to those used to perform CT scans on the human body. The study will seek to answer questions about how the events that formed and subsequently modified the continents imbued them with their buoyancy and longevity, which are crucial to their habitability. In terms of broader impacts, the project will support one graduate student and several undergraduates, including at least one from an under-represented group in STEM. <br/><br/>This study will advance understanding of the processes that form and modify cratons by developing new models of the seismic attenuation, velocity, and anisotropy structure at several cratons around the globe. To accomplish this, the study will: (1) perform co-located analyses of Rayleigh wave attenuation and anisotropic phase velocity, Ps and Sp receiver functions, and shear-wave splitting; (2) determine depth-dependent models of shear velocity, shear attenuation, and azimuthal anisotropy from the body- and surface-wave data using both forward and inverse approaches; (3) test hypotheses for the origin of midlithospheric discontinuities by interpreting the seismic models together with the elastic properties of peridotite and hydrous phases and with anelasticity experiments; (4) through incorporation of mantle-xenolith and heat-flow data, develop a method for estimating lithospheric thermal and chemical structure that can be applied in ice-covered regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
202,CAREER: Understanding Atrial Arrhythmia Mechanisms with Patient-derived Engineered Tissues,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the most common electrical conduction disorder in the heart, yet the underlying cause of AFib is poorly understood, particularly when a single gene is not responsible such as in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, a disorder in which an extra electrical pathway between the heart's upper and lower chambers causes a rapid heartbeat. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop patient-specific cellular engineered tissue models and computer models to study the roles of arrhythmic triggers, including biomechanical and emotional stress. The electrical and contractile properties of cardiac tissues engineered using stem cells obtained from WPW patients and healthy family members will be measured as the tissues are stretched and/or exposed to physiological stimulants. The knowledge gained from experiments and computer models will facilitate therapeutic development and improve patient care, thus advancing national health. Through supporting outreach and education, the project advances NSF’s mission to increase diversity and inclusion in STEM by addressing a need for cultural change in the Providence community through school science programs and art designed to engage and empower underrepresented students, parents, teachers, and the public. Activities include launching an “Engineering the Heart” 3rd grade module with teacher training and hands-on curricula and developing a science art exhibit for parents and the public to increase engagement in STEM education and encourage cultural change for equity in STEM.<br/><br/>The investigators’s research focus is on improving human heart health through developing novel technologies and platforms for regenerating muscle, predicting toxicity, and understanding disease. Consistent with this focus, the goal of this CAREER project is to understand how ion currents and tissue geometry initiate and sustain arrhythmias in WPW like fast heart rate and AFib. As the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmia are often multi-factorial, driven by structural and electrophysiological remodeling in atrial tissue, there is a significant need for developing experimental platforms that can isolate arrhythmia mechanisms in order to dissect atrial arrhythmias and enable therapeutic development. To address this need, novel human in vitro and computational models will be developed to enable individual perturbations and their combinations to elicit arrhythmic phenotypes in excitation and contraction. Physiological function will be assessed in 3D engineered tissues containing patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived atrial cardiomyocytes to address the hypothesis that mechanical stretch, a correlate of high blood pressure, and emotional stress (activation of β-adrenergic pathways or the “fight-or-flight” response) will increase automaticity, frequency-dependent contractions, and conduction irregularities to reveal reentry pathways. The research objectives are to (1) derive new patient and control hiPSC lines and evaluate differentiated atrial cardiomyocytes for atrial specificity and WPW phenotype, (2) use 3D engineered tissues to evaluate excitation and contraction responses to atrial-specific ion channel modulators and use our computational action potential model to understand hiPSC-atrial cardiomyocyte ion currents in WPW, and (3) use 3D experimental and computational macrotissues to assess how stretch and β-adrenergic stimulation modulate arrhythmic phenotypes of excitation and contraction. This research project will advance the capabilities in research to study and understand diverse arrhythmia mechanisms with tailored engineered tissue to improve the diagnosis, stratification, health, and quality of life for millions of patients with AFib.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
203,CAREER: Finite Temperature Electronic Structure Methods for Predicting Material Phase Diagrams,"Brenda Rubenstein of Brown University is jointly funded by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) to develop new methods for modeling the finite temperature electronic properties of correlated materials. In applications ranging from catalysis to astrophysics to material science, molecules and materials can be subjected to high temperatures. Nevertheless, relatively few theories exist to predict how these materials will behave at such temperatures,thwarting our ability to engineer materials such as high-Tc superconductors and next-generation thermally-responsive technologies. As part of this project, the Rubenstein Group will develop a suite of complementary theories and simulation techniques that will enable the high-accuracy modeling of complex materials at finite temperatures. In addition to this research, the Rubenstein Group will bolster its ongoing efforts to actively mentor historically-underrepresented high school students in Rhode Island through the science fair process via the Rhode Island American Chemical Society Project SEED and Advocate Programs (which Dr. Rubenstein leads) and grant area high school students opportunities to engage in real experiments through the Brown University Chemistry Department’s STEM Day Program. Dr. Rubenstein also is developing a new Accelerating Chemical Discovery course and related textbook with the aim of familiarizing undergraduates in the chemical sciences with how data science can be leveraged to solve everyday problems in chemistry.<br/><br/>The central aim of this proposal is to develop a suite of new finite temperature electronic structure techniques to elucidate the electronic phase diagrams of correlated materials. In plasmonic catalysis, astrophysics, materials science, and many other applications, molecules and materials are subject to high temperatures at which their electrons populate a wide distribution of energy levels. Nevertheless, most electronic structure methods to date have focused on the ground state, and those methods that do account for temperature either do not accurately account for electron correlation or have overwhelmingly been developed to study lattice models that do not capture the unique qualities of real materials. To rise to this challenge, the Rubenstein Group recently developed a new, fully ab initio, fully correlated finite temperature Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (FT-AFQMC) method that proved to be able to yield exact results on a wide variety of benchmark molecules and simple solids. In this CAREER proposal, the Rubenstein Group aims to extend this technique to the study of heavier materials, including iron oxide, nickel oxide, vanadium oxide, and chromium triiodide, whose finite temperature electronic phase transitions have yet to be fully understood, while also developing a set of novel supporting mean field, selected CI (configuration interaction), and sampling techniques. These will not only improve FT-AFQMC’s performance, but can also serve as cheaper, stand-alone methods in their own right.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
204,CAREER: Privacy-Compliant Web Services By Construction,"Today's web services store and process sensitive personal data without sufficient attention to data privacy. Privacy laws like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the proposed United States Consumer Data Privacy Act (CDPA) and Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (CORPA) give users new rights to control their data (e.g., access and erasure on request, rights to object to processing). With today's systems, compliance with these laws requires onerous manual labor, particularly from small and medium-sized organizations. This project investigates new systems that – by construction – comply with these privacy laws. The key idea is to provide a ""micro-database"" for each user, which stores all their data and which they can choose to withdraw or resubscribe. This design enables new, fundamentally privacy-centric models, such as automatically removing idle users' data while making it easy for the users to return. Realizing compliance-by-construction requires innovation in storage systems and data processing techniques. To succeed, compliant-by-construction systems must match the convenience and performance of today's systems, and the project will contribute systems that efficiently handle millions of per-user micro-databases by advancing the state-of-the-art in scalable computing techniques (e.g., dataflow systems).<br/><br/>The proposed research will lead to new, compliant-by-construction equivalents of today's popular web service software. These privacy-first systems will provide off-the-shelf tools that automate and ""democratize"" good privacy practices for small and medium-size organizations. This has the potential to save considerable expense, prevent costly mistakes, and improve data privacy on the internet. The work will affect academic state-of-the-art through papers, industry practice through technology transfer and open-source software, and the general public through new tools and raised awareness of privacy issues. All software developed in this project will be available as open-source code on the project website (https://cs.brown.edu/people/malte/research/privacy-by-construction.html). Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in privacy-conscious system design and implementation, and in the implications of new privacy laws for system design, through curriculum integration of the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
205,Evolutionary modification of AGS protein contributes to micromere formation in sea urchins,"Acquisition of a novel developmental program during evolution has been proposed to have important contributions to the diversity of life on earth. This research addresses fundamental problems in developmental biology: 1) how a new cell type arises in development and 2) how the evolutionary modifications of the protein could change the cell and developmental program. Specifically, this study will identify how evolutionary modifications of a protein called AGS contributed to the formation of a new cell type in the sea urchin, which is distinct from the developmental program of its relatives, such as sea stars. These questions are fundamentally applicable to any multi-cellular organism. Therefore, outcomes of this study are expected to inform the research field of cell and developmental biology. This research will also have an impact to society through various outreach programs. Those activities include providing lab tours to local students and the public, as well as active involvement in the University-wide outreach program, which brings local high school students and Brown students to explore science through interactive lessons with real-world applications. Further, this project will involve minority students in the lab where they will engage in independent research. Through these activities there will be a continuous sharing of scientific contributions to promote an interest in science among students at many levels. <br/><br/>This research will focus on Activator of G-protein signaling (AGS) to identify how evolutionary modifications contributed to the formation of micromeres that are formed through an asymmetric cell division at the 16-cell stage in the sea urchin embryo. AGS protein is a polarity factor present in various organisms, including humans. Previous research demonstrated that AGS is responsible for facilitating an asymmetric cell division at the 16-cell stage, which results in the formation of micromeres—a major signaling center that induces endomesodermal specification and thus considered as an organizer in this embryo. This fundamentally changes the mechanism of development by making it more organized. Importantly, introduction of sea urchin AGS, but not sea star AGS, induced asymmetric cell divisions and formation of organizer-like cells in the sea star embryo. Based on these observations, the project will test how AGS modification contributed to evolutionary introduction of micromeres as a new cell type, leading to the current developmental program of sea urchins. Specifically, molecular mechanisms of AGS function in micromere formation, evolutionary transition of AGS protein in the process of sea urchin diversification, and contribution of AGS protein modifications to creation of a new cell type, will be investigated using cell and embryological approaches. Experimental system of echinoderm embryos is suitable for this research program because it offers the optical transparency of the material, the ability to manipulate the cells, and the well-described developmental consequences of the unequal cell division that can be assayed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
206,Designing Professional Development to Foster Mastery and Interest for Integrating Computer Science into Mathematics Classes,"Roughly half of the US states have adopted K-12 Computer Science (CS) standards to date. Many districts, however, cannot afford standalone CS classes because they lack funding, available time in the curriculum, and/or a pool of qualified teachers to hire from. Integrating CS into existing courses (e.g., math, science, social studies) is a promising alternative. Rather than computer science being taught as an elective that not all students take, it could be taught more equitably in core courses. Moreover, districts could save resources through this strategy. Integration also showcases how computing is not inward-looking but can impact other disciplines. Unfortunately, very little research guides districts on how students learn CS in integrated contexts or how teachers gain confidence, interest, and skill to teach integrated computing content. This project, a partnership between Bootstrap and the Oklahoma Department of Secondary Education, is studying these questions in the context of integrating CS into Oklahoma's 8th and 9th grade math framework. Because these challenges to introducing CS to schooling are pervasive nationwide, this project can serve as a model for meeting these challenges. The project is also producing research findings on creating effective professional development for teachers new to CS and how these teachers develop their capacity for CS instruction.<br/><br/>This project builds on an existing Research-Practitioner Partnership (RPP) in Oklahoma that has been studying how to prepare math teachers to start integrating computing into their classes. This award expands this ongoing work to prepare teachers to integrate computing in more depth and more extensively, with 135 teachers. Using design research, results from educational psychology, and our findings to date, this project is (a) developing a 2-stage, hybrid professional development program that fosters teachers' confidence and interest in computing (including a variant specifically designed to support rural teachers), (b) adapting lessons from the state math framework to include standards-aligned computing tasks, (c) studying teachers' process of change in thinking about integration, and (d) beginning to study impacts on students. The mixed-methods research draws on surveys and longitudinal interviews with teachers, recordings of classrooms, samples of student work, and data on student assessments. This project is funded by the CS for All: Research and RPPs program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
207,IRES Track 1: Neurobiology and evolution of frog dance displays in Austria and India,"Social signals are central to animal life, mediating how individuals pick mates and compete with rivals. Understanding how these signals arise and change over time is therefore a fundamental goal of modern biology. In this IRES project, undergraduate students from around the U.S. will be trained to investigate this topic by combining cutting-edge techniques in fields of neuroscience, behavior, and computational biology. Specifically, participants will train with leading PIs that are part of an international research team that takes an integrative approach to studying how the nervous systems controls complex behavioral traits, as well as the way modifications to these physiological systems can support signal innovation. The program will recruit a total of 6 students per year, with a strong emphasis on selecting both FirstGen and underrepresented minority students. Participants will then work abroad in Austria and India for a 10-week period during the summer in the laboratory and field to conduct team-led research and independent research. This experience will be bookended with pre- and post-travel training to hone the students’ technical and cultural training, while providing extensive career preparation from a diverse set of mentors. In this way, we will focus on building skills related not only to scientific acumen, but also international proficiency and awareness. Our program therefore promises to fulfill the goals of the IRES program by producing college graduates who are ready to join the global STEM workforce in the 21st century. <br/><br/>International research collaborations are vital to biology, laying the groundwork for major discoveries that cross disciplinary lines and uncover principles about the diversity of life. However, undergraduate students from the U.S. often experience significant hurdles that prevent them from participating in such collaborative work. This is especially a problem for students from historically underrepresented groups, including both FirstGen students and underrepresented minority students. As a result, many undergraduates are ill-prepared to join the modern global STEM workforce. We therefore propose a program to address this issue by bringing 6 undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups and 1 graduate student each year to Austria and India, where they will participate in a 10-week experience studying the physiological basis of display evolution in frogs. They will conduct research in large teams and independently to investigate adaptations to motor control systems that underlying social signaling behavior. They will also use advanced phylogenetic comparative methods to track how these motor systems change over time to support the diversification and elaboration of signaling behavior in frogs. Participation in the project involves working closely with PIs in Austria and India, where our species of interests are found. It also involves combining elements of laboratory work and field work to address fundamental questions about how social signals work in physiological and functional contexts. Accordingly, students who participate in this IRES project will be given the chance to not only address fundamental questions in the field of biology, but also do so in an international context that helps prepare them for STEM careers in a global landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
208,Collaborative Research: AIM & ICERM Research Experiences for Undergraduate Faculty (REUF),"Enabling more Americans to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) is important to improving American innovation capabilities. Participating in research as undergraduates improves retention in STEM majors and encourages students to pursue graduate degrees. Faculty at colleges and universities that focus on undergraduate education are critical to this mission, yet in many cases such faculty receive little support to do research with the students they teach or to continue their own research. To address this national need, with the support of this NSF award, the American Institute of Mathematics (AIM) and the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) will conduct a series of four annual Research Experiences for Undergraduate Faculty (REUF) workshops during the summers of 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Each REUF workshop and ongoing activities will provide a new group of faculty participants at undergraduate institutions that have limited research support with a research experience investigating open questions in the mathematical sciences and equip them to engage in research with undergraduate students at their home institutions. <br/><br/>At each REUF workshop five senior mathematicians (leaders) who have experience doing research with undergraduate students will present problems in a variety of areas. Then the 25 undergraduate faculty participants and the leaders will divide into groups and work on the problems together. The workshop will conclude with group presentations of each project. Most of the time will be spent doing research, but there will also be whole group discussions about topics such as best practices in undergraduate research led by the (co)-principal investigators, who also meet daily with the leaders. There are opportunities to continue work on the projects started in the workshop, and some participants will become involved in long-term research collaborations with other faculty at the workshop. The recruitment efforts for REUF will target faculty at undergraduate colleges and universities that serve a large proportion of students who are underrepresented minorities, person with disabilities, or first generation college students, as well as faculty who are themselves underrepresented or have disabilities. The REUF project will lead to more and better undergraduate research experiences for the students of the faculty participants, and greater engagement in mathematical research by the faculty participants, thus expanding and diversifying the mathematical workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
209,Collaborative Research: LTREB: Experimental determination of trophic dynamics and energy flows in a semiarid habitat in Chile,"Long-term environmental research provides context that shorter-term efforts lack. Data collected over extended periods allows researchers to quantify the influence of fleeting or episodic factors that simply elude short-term efforts. This project started in 1989 as an experimental investigation of the importance of biotic interactions in a semiarid thorn scrub community in Bosque Fray Jorge National Park, Chile. While a role of predation was documented in early years, the overwhelming role of episodic rainfall (especially El Niño-associated rains) became clear in the first decade of work. Through the second and third decades the study focused on the relative role of biotic vs. abiotic influences, the role of invasive plans and rabbits, and the impact of extended drought conditions. Now the longest-running experimental field research program of its kind, this project has documented significant but limited effects of small mammal herbivory, and significant effects of invasive species and rainfall (and its absence) on populations of both plants and small mammals. The current research adds novel and sophisticated assessment of energy flow (from plants through consumers to predators) as a function of rainfall and hydrologic conditions, and advanced modeling of long-term population dynamics to identify mechanisms underlying changes in community stability observed in this highly variable system. Data collected at this site will be used to improve outreach efforts on the natural history and ecology of the National Park and the surrounding region, and will also be included in IsoCamp (isocamp.org), a two-week short course on stable isotope biogeochemistry and ecology for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>This project is centered on 20 experimental grids (75x75 m) in which the following activities occur: (1) small mammals are sampled monthly (4 days/month); (2) cover by shrubs is measured every three months, and that of ephemeral plants monthly during the growing season; (3) soil samples are taken every 4 months to estimate seed density; and (4) fox scat and owl pellets are collected monthly from the site and nearby roosts to characterize their diets. Whereas exclusions of one small mammal herbivore (the degu) had limited effects, installation of all‐small mammal exclusions in 2002 demonstrated strong effects on several plant species. Superimposed on these effects were dramatic responses of plants, small mammals, and predators to increased precipitation during 8 El Niño/high rainfall events. North-central Chile has experienced severe drought conditions for over a decade, but forecasters predict more frequent and intense El Niño events, suggesting extreme temporal variation in abiotic conditions. This project will continue to track the interactive roles of environmental change and invasive species, but adds novel integration of stable isotopes, fecal DNA metabarcoding, and empirical dynamic modeling to better characterize how trophic structure is influenced by temporally varying energy flows. Key foci over the next 5 years include: (1) How are plants and small mammals influenced by the presence and abundance of invasive lagomorphs?; (2) How does variation in the availability of fast-growing ephemeral herbs and slow-growing perennial shrubs influence dietary breadth and niche partitioning among small mammals?; (3) Does omnivory facilitate individual- and population-level niche partitioning during boom-bust population cycles?; (4) How does multichannel energy flow and temporal variation in trophic structure affect small mammal community stability? These goals are being pursued through extensive collaboration with multiple investigators at multiple institutions in Chile and the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

211,NNA Track 1: Collaborative Research: Navigating Convergent Pressures on Arctic Development,"Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) is one of NSF's 10 Big Ideas. NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, enhances efforts in formal and informal education, and integrates the co-production of knowledge where appropriate. This award fulfills part of that aim by addressing interactions among social systems, natural environment, and built environment in the following NNA focus areas: Arctic Residents, Data and Observation, Forecasting, Global Impact, and Resilient Infrastructure.<br/><br/>Few transformations are as dramatic or as complex as those occurring now in the Arctic. There are rapid changes in climate and the environment, in international treaties and regulations, in national security, and claims for territory. At the same time, Arctic communities and Indigenous Peoples are looking to find their place in a changing global economy. This convergence of changes and aspirations is leading to questions about what kinds of infrastructure are needed, where it should be located, and how this may impact Arctic people and environment. This project is using a combination of observations, satellites, maps, and models to identify where useful and viable locations for new development might be located. These kinds of data and analysis have not been combined before to make such an assessment. These locations are then explored with communities, emergency managers, environmental scientists, industry representatives, local governments, and members of Indigenous groups. Through this merging of environmental sciences, real-world engineering, financial analyses, and cultural concerns, the project is documenting likely future developments and understand their impacts on the Arctic environment and its people.<br/><br/>Alongside amplified Arctic environmental change, changes in global markets, regional geopolitics, and community aspirations are motivating visions of new opportunities to develop or enhance new industries in shipping, resource extraction, tourism, and fisheries. At the same time, Arctic communities and Indigenous peoples are making clear their aspirations for the future. This project asks how these converging pressures will shape Arctic development between now and 2050. The project is using an approach that is novel through its convergence of diverse disciplines, as follows. Plausible locations for development are being identified using natural resource distributions, national- and company-level ambitions, and community aspirations. High-resolution climate scenarios, observations, and satellite data are providing the environmental context for access and safety requirements. Financial and environmental assessments, regulations, and treaties provide a third layer of evaluation. The integrated product is then interrogated in an iterative manner with an independent International Reference Group of academic, Indigenous and practitioner experts. Through this process, the project is developing an assessment identifying convergent geophysical and socioeconomic pressures on Arctic development, and their potential cascading impacts on local communities, the environment, global commodity chains, and international relations. This assessment seeks to provide a knowledge resource for engagements in grounded community-based research as well as supporting communities, governments, businesses and industries seeking to navigate the New Arctic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
212,MRI: Development of microXROMM for high-resolution X-ray motion imaging of small animals,"An award is made to Brown University to develop a new biological imaging technology, “micro-XROMM.” This microXROMM instrument will have ten times the precision of current XROMM (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology). Greater precision will open up new research areas to study the bones, joints, and muscles of animals that are too small for current XROMM, such as mice, frogs, bats and birds. MicroXROMM will enable discoveries such as how small frogs can jump so far and how the shoulders of bats can allow the amazing range of wing movements in flight. Such discoveries offer fundamental insights into the biomechanics of the natural world, and also form the basis for biologically-inspired engineering designs. This project will provide training for the next generation of instrumentalists by including undergraduate and graduate students in microXROMM design and testing. Students will be drawn from diverse communities including historically under-represented groups, thus recruiting the best available talent into science and technology development. Technology development projects such as this one increase US economic competitiveness through home-grown innovation.<br/><br/>In the field of Comparative Biomechanics, XROMM has opened up whole new areas of research on the skeletal kinematics of animal movements (walking, chewing, swimming, etc.). However, more than half of all vertebrate species are too small for current XROMM precision. The microXROMM instrument will have ten times the spatial precision of current XROMM (improved from 0.1 mm to 0.01 mm), and temporal precision will be at least 1 ms (1000 frames per second). The addition of microXROMM will open the door for XROMM research on speciose small-bodied groups such as rodents, bats, songbirds, tropical frogs, skinks, anoles, coral reef fish, gobies and minnows. MicroXROMM will enrich basic research in comparative biomechanics, bioinspired design and organismal and evolutionary biology more broadly. For example, microXROMM will be suitable for studying gene knockout mouse strains, making it particularly powerful for genome to phenome studies. The products of this development project will be: (1) a multi-user microXROMM instrument at Brown University; (2) peer-reviewed publications describing the design and validating the instrument for research on species such as mice, fish and songbirds; (3) commercial availability of the system for purchase by other researchers from a US small business partner. This award is supported by the MRI program funds, and by co-funding from the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics program in the NSF-BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
213,Collaborative Research: What Processes Cause State Evolution in Rate and State Friction?,"Friction is the resistance to sliding between two surfaces in contact, whether it be on an earthquake fault, the parts of a door hinge, or pieces in an automobile engine. People have observed that if two surfaces are in contact for longer times with little sliding, greater forces are required to really get them sliding again. Although this has been known for nearly 50 years, no one is sure why it is true. Frictional surfaces actually only touch each other in many small contact spots. The most popular idea for why longer contact times make friction higher is that being in contact longer increases the total area or size of the many contact spots. However, recent results by the team planning this research project suggest that changing the strength or “quality” of those small contact spots is more important than changing their area. The team of experimentalists and theoreticians will conduct and analyze experiments in order to better understand which explanation is correct. It is important to understand this because the variations in frictional strength influence many processes of practical importance. These include whether two surfaces slide steadily or undergo alternating sticking and slipping motion. Such alternating motions occur, for example, during earthquakes or when a bow is pulled across a violin string. A better understanding of friction has implications for several economically-important industries, including manufacturing and transportation. If the results are as revolutionary as anticipated, this project will alter the research directions of scientists trying to understand jerky sliding in many disciplines. It could influence the research directions of people who are pursuing the possibility that changes in contact area are responsible for changes in friction. It would show that it is important to understand the chemical bonding at frictional contact spots. It would result in new theoretical investigations of the appropriate equations to use for applying lab results to earthquake faults. The project will also increase the skills, the knowledge, and the networks of an undergraduate student and a graduate student, as well as of the two early-career scientists involved in the theoretical parts of this project.<br/><br/>The behavior described by rate and state constitutive equations for friction has been recognized for nearly 50 years and is widely accepted as being important in the nucleation of earthquake slip. Nevertheless, there is still uncertainty regarding the micromechanical meaning of what is represented by a “state” variable in this formulation; in other words, what physical or chemical changes control state, dictating its evolution. This is unsatisfactory from a fundamental scientific point of view. It is also unsatisfactory because if the processes involved in the evolution of state are not understood and characterized by process-based equations, then extrapolation of laboratory results to understanding earthquake mechanics does not rest on a firm foundation. It is believed by many in the community that the evolution process involves time-dependent increase in the size of contacts across a frictionally sliding interface, namely evolution of contact quantity. However, evolution of contact quantity alone cannot explain recent experimental observations of friction phenomenology following normal stress steps. In contrast, the quality of the contact interface, in other words the contact shear strength per unit area, dominantly controls strength evolution following normal stress steps, a transformative observation. The team brings together experimentalists and theoreticians. They will conduct a large suite of experiments on a wide variety of geological and other materials, together with intensive theoretical modeling and inversion of the experimental results, to determine the relative contributions of changes in contact quantity and quality to evolution of state. The theoretical modeling will include discrete element modeling of granular gouge which has been recently shown to reproduce a variety of experimental findings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

215,Collaborative Research: Improving the Interpretability of Tomographic Images Using Geologically Motivated Parametrizations,"Geophysical imaging is one of the cornerstones of the Earth Sciences. Tomographic imaging techniques provide spatial descriptions of geologic features of the interior of the Earth that are otherwise inaccessible, and thus comprises a primary source of insight into the geometry of structures inside the Earth. These images are essential to understanding the evolution and dynamics of the Earth, from the relatively short length and timescales that govern natural hazards such as seismicity and volcanism, to fundamental questions of the origins of first order features such as patterns of continental motion and mountain building. This project investigates ways to fundamentally improve geophysical imaging by incorporating geological knowledge into imaging tools rather than relying solely on standard mathematical tools for imaging. Specific imaging targets include the Los Angeles, San Gabriel and San Bernardino basins, which are essential to accurately define to improve seismic hazard calculations at high frequencies and will help characterize earthquake risk in this societally important region. Another target is imaging the Yellowstone Caldera, where improved imaging can lead to better understanding of the dynamics of crustal magma emplacement and volcanic eruption dynamics. The work also brings together diverse communities of geophysicists and mathematicians and supports the education of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Geophysical imaging problems are fundamentally ill-posed so careful choices of parametrization and regularization are required to produce sensible results, especially at regional and global length scales where data are particularly scarce. Parametrizations in terms of blocks, pixels or spherical harmonics are typically driven by mathematical utility. These parametrizations ignore the fact that the end goal of tomographic imaging is typically to categorize the subsurface into discrete structures. Previous improvements in geophysical imaging have been driven by advancements in the solution of forward problems, the development of adjoint methods for large scale optimization and methods for uncertainty quantification, but comparatively little progress has been made regarding development of effective parametrization strategies for the Earth. This work melds together an innovative geometric and level set parametrization strategy for specifying Earth structure with a best-in-class derivative-free optimization scheme based on the Ensemble Kalman Filter. The project focuses on two problems that are impactful and provide complementary test cases of the team's methodology. The first application focuses on geometric optimization of geological units in the Los Angeles, San Gabriel and San Bernardino basins, from which better calculations of earthquake ground motions within the basin may be calculated. A second application at Yellowstone Caldera allows better quantification of the tradeoffs between magma chamber volume and melt fraction estimates, as determined by velocity perturbations using local and teleseismic body wave tomography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
216,"Collaborative Research: CNS Core: Large: Scaling WLANs to TB/sec: THz Spectrum, Architectures, and Control","Gigabit-per-second scale wireless transmission is already commercially available in wireless local area networks (WLANs). For example, the latest Wi-Fi standard at 60 gigahertz promises data rates up to 100 gigabits per second The objective of this project is to realize the next order of magnitude in data rate, spectrum access, directionality, and spatial multiplexing targeting terabit per second WLANs with a low-latency control plane that supports mobile clients. Namely, scaling spectrum access towards terahertz will provide a key ingredient to realize the sixth generation of wireless networks. Thus, this project will result in the design, implementation, and proof-of-concept demonstration of a WLAN architecture using spectrum from 100 gigahertz to 500 gigahertz with range exceeding 100 meters.<br/><br/>This project targets to scale multi-stream data rates to terabit per second for mobile clients via the following integrated research thrusts. The first project thrust provides two underlying building blocks for steerable and highly directional beams from 100 GHz to 500 GHz: (1) A first-of-its-kind pixelated metasurface waveguide will be developed to dynamically steer a THz beam via electrical switching of the meta-elements. (2) A THz leaky waveguide's unique property of coupling frequency and steering angle will be exploited for the first time to provide frequency-selective adaptive beam steering. The second project thrust targets scaling to high-density user populations. First, new smart reflecting surfaces will be developed that will enable engineered non-specular non-line-of-sight paths. This thrust will experimentally study the achievable network density under different architectural components, identifying empirical limits at THz scale of packing many simultaneous physical links into a limited spatial area. The third project thrust targets to provide uninterrupted Tb/sec scale communication even in the presence of user and environmental mobility. The project's methodology aims to scale the control plane to a large and dense mobile WLAN via a novel spectral signature for each transmission and reception angle. Namely, with a terahertz rainbow emitted from a leaky waveguide, a unique angular signature is derived for each path, whether line of sight, a specular reflection, or an engineered path.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
217,CAREER: Educational Trajectories and Career Plans under Uncertainty,"This project will investigate the educational trajectories and career plans of a subpopulation that is a growing segment of the U.S. workforce. This project will focus on graduate and professional degree education given their unique role in facilitating entry into the U.S. labor market. Part 1 of the project will be the compilation of a national level dataset on the educational trajectories and career plans of graduate and professional students from this subpopulation. Part 2 will be a comparison of the experiences of students across different generational groups and statuses. The project will investigate the factors that affect students’ ability to succeed in U.S. graduate and professional degree programs and affect their future career plans. The project also will establish a student research project lab to train students from multiple institutions on survey and interview-based approaches. This project is jointly funded by the Sociology Program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Science of Broadening Participation.<br/><br/>This project will use an explanatory sequential mixed methods approach consisting of an online survey followed by interviews with survey respondents. First, graduate and professional degree students nationally will be asked to complete an online survey regarding their educational experiences and future career plans. Survey questions will focus on a range of topics including student experiences pertaining to institutions attended, sources of financial and non-financial support utilized, and future planning. Second, a portion of the online survey takers will be interviewed, which will provide an important opportunity for project participants to elaborate on their answers and the process through which they came to respond as they did.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
218,Fundamental Understanding of Residual Stress in Binary and Ternary Nitride Thin Films: Measurements and Modeling,"NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Nitride thin films are widely used in applications such as protective tool coatings and microelectronic interconnects. However, the deposited films often have large amounts of residual stress that can reduce their performance or lead to failure. A more fundamental understanding of the connection between the film deposition conditions and the resulting stress is needed in order to control and predict the stress. This understanding is achieved by performing comprehensive measurements and using them to develop a model that can predict the stress under different conditions. This provides a science-based method to choose the processing parameters instead of trial-and-error. Sharing this model with others impacts the broad community of thin film users by providing a tool to analyze and optimize their growth processes. The students who are trained on this project develop a deep understanding of the kinetic processes controlling thin film growth that are valuable in industries such as automotive components and semiconductor processing. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The research on stress in nitride thin films integrates measurements with the development of a quantitative model. The measurements are performed in real-time during the deposition of the films using an optical technique. The different processing parameters (growth rate, pressure, nitrogen flow rate) are systematically varied so that a comprehensive set of data is generated. The measurements are done on both binary nitrides (nitride with a single transition metal species) and ternary nitrides (nitride with two transition metal species) with different compositions. The data is used to develop a set of rate equations based on the underlying kinetic mechanisms that can calculate the stress for different processing conditions. Applying the model equations to the experiments allows a set of kinetic parameters to be extracted for each material. This is important for interpreting the data and understanding the processes controlling the stress. It also transforms the method of choosing processing conditions by predicting parameters that can produce the desired stress. A user-friendly web-based version of the model can be used by others to analyze their own results and select the best processing conditions for their needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
219,CAREER: Targeting therapeutic liposomes to fungal infections,"Fungal species have not garnered the same attention as their microbial (e.g. bacteria) counterparts despite the fact that more than 150 million people are estimated to have serious fungal infections worldwide, leading to 1.6 million deaths annually. The arsenal of antifungals is highly limited compared to antibacterial agents, and many existing antifungals suffer from complications including host toxicity that hinder their clinical use. With rising antifungal resistance, it is critical to develop effective antifungal therapies that overcome these limitations. Nanoparticles are highly promising for this application; however, there has not yet been a significant focus on developing antifungal nanotherapeutics. The goal of this CAREER project is to investigate methods of targeting newly developed nanoparticles containing antifungal drugs to fungal cells. Molecules that have been shown to interact with fungal cells and fungal cell enzymes will be used to decorate these nanoparticles and promote their interactions with fungal cells. The antifungal activity of these formulations is expected to exceed that of the free drug and to limit host toxicity. This work will lay the foundation for a paradigm shift towards targeted nanomaterials for infection treatment. This project will also engage the broader community through interactions with public school science teachers to develop teacher-driven STEM curriculum for high school classrooms using an inquiry-based learning approach focused around advances in nanoengineering. A new undergraduate nanoengineering course at the Investigator's institution will support this curriculum development by working with teachers and classrooms in implementing “science kits.” These kits will be developed by the undergraduate students to provide an economical, grade appropriate activity demonstrating a nanoengineering concept and its relevance to our daily lives.<br/><br/>The Investigator’s overarching research mission is to identify and develop biomaterials addressing critical clinical needs in the areas of drug delivery and regenerative medicine, with a focus on infectious diseases. Toward this mission, this Career project’s focus is on improving treatments for fungal infections by investigating the use of peptide ligands to target newly synthesized antifungal liposomal nanoparticles to fungal cells. The peptide ligands selected will be based on recent advances in the study of peptides as antimicrobial agents and protease inhibitors. The project will investigate whether the decoration of liposomes with these peptide ligands enables targeting of fungal cells and will elucidate the mechanism by which potential targeting occurs. The central hypothesis is that targeted antifungal formulations will exhibit improved antifungal activity and reduced host cell toxicity compared to free drug and non-targeted formulations. This hypothesis will be tested through three research objectives. The FIRST Objective is to develop and characterize antifungal formulations with and without targeting peptides. These formulations will contain a drug from each of the major antifungal drug classes. The physicochemical properties of the liposomes (size, charge, morphology) will be thoroughly characterized. The SECOND Objective is to study the antifungal activity and potential targeting mechanism of these formulations in vitro using Candida as the model parasitic fungus. Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the mode of targeting (e.g., cell wall binding versus intracellularization) will be dictated by the peptide ligand choice; targeting mechanism will in turn, affect the activity of the encapsulated drug based on the drug mechanism of action. Toxicity to human red blood cells and endothelial cells will be investigated as a measure of selectivity. The THIRD Objective will further elucidate the antifungal activity and targeting capability of these formulations using select in vivo studies in Candida infected Galleria mellonella insects and mice. This approach will clarify whether active targeting has advantages over passive targeting. This objective also has the potential to provide information on EPR (Enhanced Permeability and Retention) in fungal infections. This work will lay the foundation for a paradigm shift towards targeted nanomaterials for infection treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
220,CAREER: The onset of the rainy season in Amazonia,"The Amazon basin has been called the ""Green Ocean"", a term inspired by the emerald expanse of its dense forest canopy. In the rainy season the analogy has physical significance as the rain falls primarily from mid-depth cumulus clouds which resemble those commonly found over tropical oceans. Also, the forested surface provides an abundant source of moisture to sustain the clouds, playing the same role as the ocean surface in maritime convection. But prior work by the PI shows that at the end of the dry season the analogy breaks down and clouds look more like the cumulus towers that form over dry grasslands. The surface also plays a different role, as the deep clouds are triggered by high values of convective available potential energy (CAPE), and the surface serves primarily as a heat source to build CAPE rather than a moisture source.<br/><br/>Recognizing the differing roles of moist and dry land surface, the principal investigator (PI) considers the role played by plant physiology in cloud formation during the pre-onset season (also referred to as the transition season). Water stress is common at the end of the dry season and vegetation under water stress retains moisture, causing the surface to heat up and promoting higher CAPE. On the other hand clouds need a source of water vapor, which can be supplied by plant transpiration in adjacent regions where the soil is still moist. Thus the PI hypothesizes that rising motion induced by surface heating over water stressed regions draws in moisture from regions of low water stress (where plants transpire moisture into the air), so that the gradient between high and low plant water stress plays a key role in promoting convection at the onset of the rainy season.<br/><br/>The research uses observational data from sources including satellite remote sensing and meteorological reanalysis products, together with numerical simulations, to cover the range of phenomena and spatial scales linking plant physiology with clouds and precipitation. One key data source is satellite-derived Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF), a subtle and wavelength-specific glow emitted by chlorophyll in plants exposed to sunlight. Previous studies have shown that SIF declines when plants are under water stress, thus SIF from satellites can be used to map the spatial gradient of water stress over the Amazon.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER award focuses on outreach to K-12 and college students from underserved and underrepresented populations. At the college level the PI works with the Leadership Alliance Summer Research Early Identification Program to provide summer internships for undergraduates from minority serving institutions. K-12 education is addressed in collaboration with the Providence Public Schools (PPS), which serve a high percentage of Hispanic and African American students. The PI's team works with PPS officials to organize summer workshops for elementary and middle school teachers to assist them in creating and implementing lesson modules on weather, climate and ecosystem interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
221,CAREER: Learning Neurosymbolic 3D Models,"High-quality 3D models are increasingly in demand, driven by numerous industries and by the need for synthetic training data to scale up autonomous vision systems. But creating such models is a laborious and time-consuming process requiring years of training, so current practice will be insufficient to satisfy future data demands. One way forward is through generative models of 3D objects, that is to have machines learn to synthesize high-quality objects, a nice vision which has yet to be realized. Existing 3D generative models fall into one of two broad categories, each with limitations. Symbolic generative models such as shape grammars can enable non-experts to generate high-quality geometry but have severely limited expressiveness, while neural generative models are flexible and can in theory learn to express any shape but they are inscrutable and produce flawed geometry. This project will explore a new class of generative shape model that combines the best of both worlds: neuro-symbolic 3D models. The main insight is to use a symbolic program to model the logical part structure of a 3D object (e.g., the legs of a chair are connected to its seat), and then to use neural networks to refine this structure into high-quality geometry. Such a representation supports synthesis of new objects, reconstruction of objects from real-world sensor input, and high-level editing of object structure and geometry. It also supports modeling of higher-order object properties, including kinematics and physics. To enable massive-scale generation of synthetic 3D training data for computer vision and robotics, a neuro-symbolic version of the widely used ShapeNet dataset will be implemented and released. To help democratize 3D content creation, the project will collaborate with Unity Technologies to integrate neuro-symbolic 3D models into their popular 3D graphics engine. Project outcomes will also include an open-source, pedagogical deep learning framework to educate a new generation of researchers with the multidisciplinary skillset needed for neuro-symbolic modeling, in concert with activities (e.g., piloting new integrated visual computing curricula via summer schools and hosting visiting student researchers from historically under-represented groups) designed to improve student mastery of neural network fundamentals.<br/><br/>The recognition-by-components theory of vision posits that people recognize objects by first understanding their fundamental parts and then using a secondary process to handle objects that are not distinguishable by these parts alone. Neuro-symbolic 3D models operationalize this theory for object synthesis via two algorithmic phases. The first phase is a new procedural representation called a hierarchical part graph program that is a human-readable computer program which, when executed, constructs a graph of connected object parts at multiple levels of detail wherein the bottom level of detail consists of parametric primitives such as cuboids and cylinders. While suggestive of shape, these graphs do not capture the full variety of geometry found in real-world objects. Thus, the second phase of the model is a new neural adaptive subdivision procedure which converts the low-fidelity parts into high-fidelity surface geometry. This decomposition is a natural fit for the common case of human-made objects, but it can also be extended to organic objects. The hypothesis is that this approach to 3D object generation will be able to efficiently synthesize and reconstruct a variety of high-quality objects in a unified, easily-editable representation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
222,Grain and Phase Boundaries in Mantle Assemblages: Atom Probe and Electron Microscopy/Diffraction Approaches,"The research pursued under this grant seeks to enhance understanding of the chemistry and physics of grain boundaries in crystalline solids, with particular emphasis on boundaries in silicate materials representative of the upper mantle of the Earth. Typical crystalline solids consist of myriad crystals (grains), frequently having random spatial orientation, bonded together across ribbon-like, two-dimensional boundaries. These boundaries have specific structure and chemistry, different in fundamental ways from the grains on either side; the boundaries frequently control the physical properties of the solid overall, e.g., strength, viscosity, electrical and ionic conductivity, optical transmittance, etc. In Earth and planetary science, the community’s interests reflect the breadth of these properties, although particularly the mechanical and electrochemical ones: boundaries between grains of the same mineral, boundaries between grains of different minerals (phase boundaries) and boundaries between minerals and melts affect directly phenomena such as (i) the rate of mantle deformation (which effects plate tectonics), (ii) the attenuation of seismic wave energy, and (iii) the chemical composition of magmas (particularly of trace elements, which facilitates understanding of melting and magma-migration processes in the Earth). Prominent in this specific research is the application of a new and exciting analytical technique to the study of grain- and phase-boundary structure and chemistry: atom probe tomography (APT). With appropriate care in specimen preparation and data analysis, APT can characterize boundary chemistry at the very atomic scale, allowing precise questions concerning materials dynamics to be posed and scrutinized. A beauty of the approach is that one can so learn the physics of scaling of mechanical and chemical responses from the sub-nanometer to the kilometer-plus dimensions. The research has implications both economic and in workforce development. Grain- and phase-boundary structure and chemistry in ionic and covalent-bonded solids (as are minerals) is a primary concern in the development of advanced ceramics for battery/fuel cell, photovoltaic, and structural applications. Employing APT in an effective way for the chemical design of grain/phase boundaries is a direct extension of the research supported here. The “effective way” caveat has everything to do with advances in APT approach (specimen preparation, imaging conditions, data analysis): these necessary advances will constitute no small part of the education accumulated—and promulgated—by the program participants. <br/><br/>The research specifically focuses on grain and phase boundary structure and chemistry in (a) deformed rock of upper-mantle chemistry/mineralogy (olivine plus pyroxenes) and (b) olivine grain boundary interface(s) with a host magma. The former focus examines mantle aggregates deformed (experimentally) in diffusion creep–grain/phase boundary sliding. Characterizing the impact of the spatial orientation of deviatoric stress on boundary structure and chemistry can elucidate aspects of the physics of plastic instability in the mantle—a crucial issue in creating and sustaining plate tectonics. The latter focus addresses issues in the crystallization of basaltic magma and the role grain boundaries might play in (i) storing incompatible trace elements as well as (ii) affecting/effecting the mobilization of large magma bodies that are partially crystallized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
223,RESEARCH-PGR: Genomic analysis of heat stress tolerance during tomato pollination,"High temperatures during flowering and pollination can result in significant fruit losses, because of heat sensitivity of pollen tube growth. Different tomato varieties show significant differences in heat sensitivity of pollen tube growth. Making use of this naturally occurring variety, this project seeks to identify the molecular basis of adaptations that mitigate the yield-damaging consequences of heat stress during crop reproduction. The goal is to develop new tomato varieties that are fertile and continue to produce fruits at high temperature. This project will train undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in genome science, developmental biology, and computational analysis of genetic variation. The project will build on the successful outreach program developed by one of the team members. This program has been used to teach plant genetics and the science of plant breeding and genetic engineering to more than 1000 9th grade students, tailoring it to focus on the effects of temperature stress on tomato reproduction.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that thermotolerant tomato varieties express a pollen tube heat stress response that is either absent or diminished in thermosensitive cultivars and that the thermotolerant pistil buffers heat stress and facilitates pollen tube growth. To identify the molecular mechanisms of thermotolerance in tomato, transcription changes that accompany heat stress in pollen tubes and pistil will be measured in heat tolerant and heat sensitive tomato varieties. Haploid selection mapping of pollen tube heat tolerance will be performed, followed by experimental tests whether identified candidate genes are causally related to heat tolerance. This project will generate accessible and readily available community databases 1) detailing reproductive gene expression responses to elevated temperature and 2) registering genetic variants across hundreds of tomato genomes to enable analysis of heat stress adaptation and other traits. The project will define the transcriptional changes that accompany heat stress in the pollen tube and pistil (Aim 1), genetic variation responsible for pollen tube thermotolerance (Aims 2 and 3), and the functions of individual thermotolerance genes using reverse genetics (Aim 4).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
224,CAREER: Understanding Quasicrystalline Superstructures Formed from Pyramidal Nanocrystals,"Non-Technical Summary:<br/>Crystalline materials are characterized by a structure with a regular, repeating pattern of atoms, while amorphous materials such as glass are disordered. Quasicrystalline (QC) materials are unusual in that they are ordered but not periodic, making them a fundamentally different category of materials which is neither a crystal nor a glass. The unique structure gives QC materials intriguing thermal, electrical, magnetic, optical and mechanical properties, making them useful for applications such as non-stick and thermally insulating coatings or corrosive-resistant and extremely strong materials for medical devices and surgical instruments. This CAREER award, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, enables study of QC materials self-assembled from pyramid-shaped nano-sized particles (nanocrystals). The project includes detailed characterization of new QC materials’ structures and formation processes and also develops new characterization and growth methods that may be applicable to studying other soft matter assembly systems. The research offers ample fundamental and visual interest, as well as technological relevance, all of which are integrated into the PI’s education and outreach activities. YouTube movies with a jargon-free, storytelling style are created and promoted through various social media platforms. These videos take unique advantage of the connection between the beautiful and eye-catching QC patterns created by this fundamental study and real-world art, decoration and architectural design. Additionally, the project supports outreach to local high school students through an annual STEM Day. <br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/>This CAREER project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program within the Division of Materials Research, integrates education and research on quasicrystalline (QC) superstructures assembled from pyramid-shaped nanocrystals (NCs). Self-assembly of NCs into novel superstructures is a promising approach for transporting nanoscopic properties into macroscopic materials to eventually enable highly efficient solar cells, low-energy-consumption lighting and displays, and more sensitive biological sensors. To realize these opportunities requires rational control over the formation of NC superstructures. Quasicrystals are ordered but not periodic and as such defy classification as either a crystal or a glass. The study of NC QC superlattices (QC-SLs) is in its infancy compared to efforts on conventional NC crystalline superstructures. It remains an outstanding question how NCs organize into these long-range ordered yet aperiodic lattices; methods to produce and characterize these unique materials are limited. To address these issues, the PI's group first synthesizes anisotropic pyramidal NCs and assembles them into QC superstructures. These materials are then characterized using combinations of in situ and ex situ real space methods (electron microscopies and tomography) complemented by reciprocal space measurements (electron diffraction and X-ray scattering). In addition to 2D superlattices, 3D QC supercrystals grown via microfluidics will be structurally characterized using a new super-crystallography technique. Together, these tools provide exquisite detail concerning the packing of these structures and specify the relative orientation of individual NCs. Such information clarifies how NC synthesis, superstructure formation and transformation work together to create QC superstructures. Results generated in this research are integrated into a series of outreach activities that target younger students and adults alike with compelling, visual stories designed to provoke interest in science and technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
225,DMREF: Collaborative Research: Systematic discovery of materials platforms for spin-light quantum interfaces,"Nontechnical description: Certain types of defects in solids - for example, an isolated impurity atom, or a vacancy where an atom is missing from the crystal - act like trapped molecules whose quantum-mechanical states can be controlled through use of light and electronics. Such defects are employed today as the basis for emerging applications in quantum information science, especially as single-photon sources, quantum memories, and quantum sensors. However, only a small number of potential defect systems, within a limited set of host materials, have been explored for this purpose, and those systems have specific properties that are not optimal for every application. Alternative defects, potentially occurring in materials that have been largely ignored, offer potential advantages, but the identification and development of new quantum defects has historically been a slow and arduous process. The goal of this DMREF project is to dramatically accelerate the discovery process for quantum defects in solids, by combining new computational and experimental techniques in an efficient paradigm inspired by the Materials Genome Initiative. The collaborating researchers will predict the basic properties of defects in a large number of materials, identify those systems best suited for the application at hand, fabricate and identify the target defects using high-throughput experimental methods, and establish their potential for applications in quantum science, especially as ""spin-light interfaces"" that will serve as the basis for future quantum networks. The research project will prepare multiple graduate and undergraduate students for future employment in the quantum workforce, and its outreach programs will introduce concepts of quantum science and technology to the general public through virtual and in-person activities. <br/><br/>Technical description: Point defects in wide-bandgap semiconductors have emerged as leading platforms for quantum information science and technology, because they host isolated electron and nuclear spin states that can be addressed optically and electronically for use as qubits and quantum sensors. However, most research to date has concentrated on only a few defect systems and host materials, and the identification of new defect systems has been a slow, arduous, and generally ad hoc process. Given the vast number of potential materials and defect configurations, it remains a major challenge to theoretically predict and experimentally identify promising candidates in a systematic way. This collaborative DMREF project will address this challenge by combining new computational and experimental techniques to accelerate the discovery of defects, dopants, and host materials optimized for spin-light quantum interfaces. Computationally efficient analytic group theory-based models supported by judicious use of ab initio and low-energy numerical calculations will facilitate the systematic discovery of electronic systems with desired properties, while novel high-throughput single-emitter spectroscopy techniques will enable rapid experimental characterization. The immediate goal of the project is to identify previously unexplored spin systems that support coherent spin-photon interfaces at or near room temperature, using state-of-the art techniques for quantum dynamical control. More broadly, the ability to select defects that satisfy particular materials and application requirements will revolutionize solid-state quantum engineering and lead to diverse new applications of quantum science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
226,Collaborative Research: Perspective taking and reported speech in an evidentially-rich language,"Storytelling and conversation often require that speakers share something that has been said by someone else, known as ""reported speech."" Tremendous variation occurs cross-linguistically in terms of the different linguistic means by which speakers convey their own perspective on a segment of reported speech, including the extent to which speakers agree or disagree with it in content or tone. The notion of ""perspective shift"" is not only an area of linguistic significance, but is also important to theories of cognition, but considerable gaps in our knowledge of these processes exist. This project seeks to addresses some of those gaps to advance a better understanding of perspective in linguistic theory and cognition through analysis of an endangered language of Ecuador, A'ingae, which employs a typologically unique mechanism to signal perspective shift by producing a word that is unusually or unnaturally high, known as falsetto. The project will create a diverse collection of narratives useful for future scientific and cultural endeavors, as well as innovative methodological advances like digital animation and interactive board games to examine language use in context. Broader impacts also include the training of undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups at two US universities in scientific research methods, technical skills like digital animation, as well as hands-on experience working with diverse groups of stakeholders in an international collaboration. <br/><br/>The study of perspective shift within discourse and sentences is one of the most important areas of semantics and pragmatics research, and it is one where the study of indigenous and endangered languages has proven especially crucial. This project explores these issues through the documentation of an understudied language whose grammar allows for the explicit expression of perspective shift of a sort which is implicit in English and other more well-studied languages. The perspective-shifting use of falsetto in A'ingae (CON), a linguistic isolate of Ecuador, can co-occur with other reported speech devices in the language including lexical verbs like ""say"" and ""tell"", as well as reportative and quotative clitics. To understand more precisely the kind of perspective shift that falsetto in A'ingae encodes, the project will analyze the broader domain of reported speech and perspective-taking through the collaborative creation of an annotated digital corpus of naturalistic speech and careful consideration of how these devices impact deictic and other perspective-sensitive elements with which they co-occur. Specifically, speakers produce a single syllable of falsetto in order to indicate shifts between different perspectives in discourse, a shift that is largely or entirely implicit in other languages, thereby shedding light on perspective-taking processes which are often quite difficult to observe in other languages. This project, in addition to creating important documentary materials and linguistic training opportunities, will provide important insights on the rich techniques that speakers use to signal perspective taking and perspective shifting. The issues impact many areas of semantics and pragmatics and this theoretical focus dove-tails naturally with broad coverage language documentation, as perspective-taking can be studied only in rich and diverse discourse contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
227,Self-Organization and Collective Decision-Making in Human Crowds,"The collective motion of bird flocks, fish schools, and human crowds are prime examples of self-organized behavior in biological systems. This project will investigate the local interactions between individuals in a crowd that trigger collective motion and whether the same mechanisms yield collective decisions, such as which 'leaders' to follow. The results will contribute to a mathematical model of pedestrian and crowd behavior, with the aim of explaining and predicting crowd dynamics in real-world environments. An interactive crowd simulator will be posted on the Web. The research has many societal benefits, including applications to evacuation planning, safe building design, real-time monitoring and forecasting of crowd disasters, and the design of social robots. The results will also contribute to research on evacuation behavior and navigation systems for the blind. Moreover, an understanding of human behavior in virtual environments has implications for the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier, one of NSF's 'Big Ideas,' as well as for the design of immersive social media. The project will also contribute to educating the next generation of scientists by training undergraduate and graduate students, particularly students from underrepresented groups, in experimental research and the use of virtual reality technology and computational modeling methods.<br/><br/>It is generally believed that collective behavior emerges from local interactions between individuals. Thus, the key to explaining collective motion lies in understanding the rules of engagement that govern these interactions and the neighborhood of interaction over which they operate. There are many different models of collective motion and collective decision-making in fields as disparate as mathematical biology, computer animation, physics, and robotics. However, few of them are based on experimental evidence about the rules that actually govern local interactions and how they generate global patterns of collective motion. This project tests whether competing models can explain (a) the onset and propagation of collective motion, the crux of self-organization, and (b) collective decision-making by a crowd, such as whether to turn right or left or which subgroup to follow. In particular, the research will determine the role of leadership in collective decisions and whether strategically positioned leaders can control a crowd's motion. Researchers will answer these questions using a combination of experiments on 1) a human participant walking in a virtual crowd to decipher the local recruitment and decision rules; 2) agent-based simulations of the data to test competing models; 3) analysis of real crowd data using methods of network reconstruction to determine the causal networks in a crowd; and 4) use of pinning control to predict the influence of leaders (confederates) in real crowd experiments, using large-scale motion capture techniques. The result of this project will be an empirically-grounded model that accounts for the self-organization of collective motion and the emergence of collective decisions in human crowds, a significant step toward a general kinetic theory of collective behavior.<br/><br/>The Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems participated in co-funding this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
228,Collaborative Research: Origins of Southeast Asian Rainforests from Paleobotany and Machine Learning,"Fossil leaves are the most abundant record of ancient plant life and millions of specimens are contained in museum collections around Fossil leaves are the most abundant record of ancient plant life, and millions of specimens are contained in museum collections around the world, with more discoveries every year. Nevertheless, leaf fossils alone currently provide limited information about the evolution of regional and global plant communities because individual leaf characteristics from a single plant species can vary widely, and detailed, time-consuming examination of each leaf fossil might still not connect it to its true biological family. This project addresses the problem in two ways. First will be the development of the Virtual Paleobotany Assistant (VPA), an artificial intelligence tool that will use machine learning techniques to rapidly analyze leaf characteristics to assign individual fossils to plant families and orders. The VPA, together with more traditional methods of paleobotany, will then be used to interpret the origins of the incredibly diverse tropical rain forests that now exist in Southeast Asia. These plant communities evolved during times of major continental movements and have connections to the former supercontinent of Gondwana, the Indian subcontinent, and Eurasia. Ascertaining the evolutionary and biogeographic pathways that led to the assembly of these tropical forests will help in preserving this important natural resource as the regional human population burgeons. The VPA will be made freely available on the internet and mobile platforms, enabling paleobotanists around the world to make discoveries far beyond this project. The unique collaboration between paleontologists and machine-learning experts will create extremely fertile ground for interdisciplinary advances, while catalyzing new international partnerships and student opportunities. <br/><br/>The project addresses two of the most difficult challenges in paleobotany, fossil leaf identification and the fossil history of Southeast Asian (Malesian) rainforests. Decoding the biological affinities of leaf fossils holds central significance for the improved knowledge of plant evolution, biogeography, and paleoclimate. This project will use deep learning on image databases of extant and fossil leaves to develop the first application (the Virtual Paleobotany Assistant, VPA) for computer-assisted identifications of leaf fossils to plant families and orders. The living floras of Southeast Asia are composed of a stunningly complex juxtaposition of plant lineages that diversified after arriving from disparate sources, including Gondwana (fossils to be studied in Patagonia and Australia), the Indian Plate (India and Pakistan), and Eurasia (South China, Indochina, Malay Archipelago). However, the diverse biogeographic components remain poorly understood due to limited paleobotanical data in many of the source areas. Many widely cited hypotheses are weakly corroborated from fossils; paleobotany and machine vision will coordinate to reveal the identities of fossil plants, correlate them to the geologic time scale, and re-interpret Malesia's floristic history. The influx of new paleobotanical data will test fundamental hypotheses about the relative contributions to Southeast Asian rainforest floras from different source areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
229,SBE-UKRI: Integrating vision and action through selection history,"Most real-world visual scenes are complex and crowded, where multiple objects compete for attention and goal-directed action. In daily life, for example, a person easily picks up a red apple from a grocery display containing many kinds of fruit. Successful interactions with such complex environments require seamless coordination among multiple mechanisms. In particular, mechanisms of attentional selection that help us make sense of the world work in unity with those that underlie action selection, allowing us to generate adaptive movements. This attention-action synergy is at the root of all complex behavior. However, researchers typically study these two mechanisms separately, without investigating interactions between them. This practice makes direct comparisons between the findings in attentional selection and action selection impossible. To overcome this gap, the goal of this proposal is to determine the interplay between mechanisms controlling attentional selection and action selection, particularly when recent selection history biases subsequent behavior. It will provide a basis for unifying theories of behavioral mechanisms involved in the selection of attention and action in a global frame. <br/><br/>Specifically, the proposed project will focus on three understudied aspects of action selection: variation in action execution, effectors, and biomechanical costs, to determine their novel relations with the wealth of research on selection history of perceptual features. To ensure successful outcomes, an international collaboration between the two research teams, who will play complementary and synergistic roles, will be formed between experts in attention and motor control and computational modeling. This joint endeavor will advance our understanding of the interdependence between attention and action-driven mechanisms to eventually explain adaptive, real-world selection behavior. By including talented undergraduates including nationally selected underrepresented minorities, this proposal also intends to foster the integration of research, STEM and a broad education. Furthermore, outcomes can also contribute to significant technological innovations, including foundation for novel control architecture for robot arms and teleoperators, improving human-computer-interface such as cognitive neural prosthetics and the widely used touch-user-interfaces (e.g. smart phones).<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded with the UK's Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) under the SBE-UKRI Lead Agency collaborative research opportunity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
230,CAREER:  Algebraic Curves and Their Moduli: Degenerations and Combinatorics,"Algebraic geometry is a central subject in mathematics and has connections and applications to many areas in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Algebraic geometers study spaces called algebraic varieties that are defined by polynomial equations. One powerful method of studying these spaces, as used in this project, is the method of degenerations, where a parametrized family of algebraic varieties breaks into pieces in the limit. Roughly speaking, the idea is that one studies the combinatorics, i.e. the discrete data, of the pieces, in order to deduce things about the more complicated original space. The educational component of the project includes a Women in Algebraic Geometry Workshop and a seminar series on diversity and inclusion in mathematics.<br/><br/>The research supported by this award will center on using modern degeneration techniques, especially those from the field of tropical geometry, to study classical spaces from algebraic geometry. In one direction, the PI will use these techniques to study the topology of classical moduli spaces of curves and abelian varieties. In another direction, the PI will also advance our understanding of Brill-Noether varieties using the combinatorics of set-valued tableaux, and investigate questions in tableau combinatorics that were motivated by the program in Brill-Noether theory. This award will also support a Women in Algebraic Geometry workshop and a seminar series on diversity and inclusion in mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
231,Collaborative Research:  Imaging small-scale convection and structure of the mantle in the south Pacific:  a US contribution to international collaboration PacificArray,"All deformation on the surface of Earth, including faulting responsible for earthquakes, is produced by the motion of tectonic plates. It is widely accepted that thermal convection in the mantle drives plate motion, but details of that convection and how exactly it moves the plates are poorly understood. Oceanic plates make up 70% of the Earth's surface and offer important windows into mantle convection, yet they are largely unexplored due to the lack of seismic data from the ocean basins. Questions abound regarding the thermal structure of oceanic plates, the significance of volcanism in the middle of oceanic plates, and how the convecting mantle beneath the plates controls their movements. Waves in the gravity field and un-explained shallowing of the ocean floors hint at small-scale convection beneath the oceanic plates. This project contributes to an international effort to strategically place temporary arrays of instruments across the Pacific Ocean basin that record the energy from earthquakes. Recent community advances in ocean bottom seismographs will be used to record unique datasets in locations where large gaps in coverage exist today. These data will allow us to infer deformation and variations in mantle temperature related to small-scale convection. As part of the international collaboration, all data will be openly available to scientists worldwide. The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will collect 12-15 months of broadband ocean bottom seismograph (OBS) data in two 30-station arrays in the central and southern Pacific. These arrays, deployed at two distinct plate ages (~30 Ma and ~120 Ma), will address specific critical questions on the dynamics of the oceanic asthenosphere, including its underlying state (temperature, presence of melt, water or other volatiles, and deformation mechanism). The arrays are designed to image the anisotropic velocity signature of small-scale convection, which has been invoked to explain the flattening of the age versus depth curve in old ocean plates, 140-200 km wavelength gravity lineations, and ubiquitous off-axis, non-plume volcanism observed at a variety of scales. Anisotropic surface wave and body wave tomographic models will be supplemented by shear wave splitting and attenuation measurements to obtain a multi-faceted understanding of the asthenosphere and base of the plates. Finally, the order-of-magnitude increases in path coverage for surface and body waves in the south-central Pacific will enable new advances in global tomography."
